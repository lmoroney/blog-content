<p>Now and then is a beautiful song, and it will be the last song from the Beatles. Made possible by AI extracting audio of old recording sessions to access content such as John Lennonâ€™s voice, itâ€™s an epic and beautiful recording.</p>

<p>And itâ€™s particularly poignant when you listen to the lyrics â€œNow and then, I miss you, I want you to be there for meâ€</p>

<p>Work on the track started in February 1995 as part of the Beatles anthology project, but it had to halt because of the technological challenges in extracting Johnâ€™s voice from a tape recording from 20 years earlier. It looked like it wouldnâ€™t be possible.</p>

<p>Then, enter Peter Jackson, of â€˜Lord of the Ringsâ€™ fame, who figured out how to uncouple Johnâ€™s vocal from background sound. Itâ€™s musical archaeology in action.</p>

<p>And itâ€™s a beautiful and fitting song!</p>
