I"ð<p>My passion at the moment is cross-platform mobile development, and enabling developers to create Machine Learning applications that run on Android or iOS.</p>

<p>With that in mind, my <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-and-machine/9781098101732/">next book</a> due in September is about exactly that!</p>

<p>From the publisher:
AI is nothing without somewhere to run it. Now that mobile devices have become the primary computing device for most people, itâ€™s essential that mobile developers add AI to their toolbox. This insightful book is your guide to creating models and running them on popular mobile platforms such as iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Laurence Moroney, lead AI advocate at Google, offers an introduction to machine learning techniques and tools, then walks you through writing Android and iOS apps powered by common ML models like computer vision and text recognition, using tools such as ML Kit, TensorFlow Lite, and Core ML. If youâ€™re a mobile developer, this book will help you take advantage of the ML revolution today.</p>

<p>Explore the options for implementing ML and AI on mobile devicesâ€“and when to use each
Create ML models for iOS and Android
Write ML Kit and TensorFlow Lite apps for iOS and Android and Core ML/Create ML apps for iOS
Understand how to choose the best techniques and tools for your use case: on-device inference versus cloud-based inference, high-level APIs versus low-level APIs, and more
Learn privacy and ethics best practices for ML on devices</p>
