I"Æ<p>I really love the combination of the â€˜Ken Burnsâ€™ effect to bring images to life, with a way to cut the image up into layers, and then move each layer separately.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s usually a lot of work in photoshop.</p>

<p>But now, with the amazing work from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05483">Simon Niklaus et al</a>, it seems that ML models can perform this task by using segmentation to figure out foreground from background and inpainting to fill in the missing pixels.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s ingenious.</p>

<p>I played with the image from above, and got this:</p>

<p>Still a bit of work to be done, and Iâ€™m hoping I can tweak for higher resolution in the video, but the effect is definitely stunningâ€¦considering itâ€™s entirely automated!</p>
