I"š<p>Impressions of the WWDC Keynote</p>

<p>TL;DR A definite change in attitude from Apple. A lot less hubris while delivering a condensed, concise set of features and updates to multiple operating systems while still keeping it clear and relevant for developers. My thoughts on iOS and iPadOS updates:</p>

<h2 id="ios-15">iOS 15:</h2>

<p>Updates to the social experience came thick and fast, from SharePlay that allows you to watch, listen and work together through a facetime call to spatial audio so that voices will sound like theyâ€™re coming from where the person is located on the screen. Not sure about the latter, given that phone screens are small, but letâ€™s wait and see. I <em>love</em> Spatial Audio when used with things like Airpods Max and the Disney+ App, so Iâ€™m hopeful!</p>

<p>I love the new Mic modes so that you can reduce background noise for meetings etc. Nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary here â€“ itâ€™s stuff youâ€™ve probably experienced before on different apps or platforms. Still, it will be worth exploring with the regular Apple polish and tight integration.</p>

<p>There are also updates to messenger, where the ability to share things like pictures in messages is greatly improved. Photo collections where automated slideshows integrating music from Apple Music are a nice touch, but again, merely an incremental improvement on what has gone before.</p>

<p>It also includes a â€˜Focusâ€™ ability which integrates down to things like message settings, which is nice. I havenâ€™t figured out how to use it yet, though!</p>

<p>Maps have a whole host of updates, with beautiful new cartoon-like visualizations.</p>

<p>The immersive walking instructions appear to have been lifted directly from Google Maps, though! Seeing stuff I used several years ago on my Android, now being portrayed as â€˜new,â€™ is annoying!</p>

<p>Safari has also had a refresh to make it a little more mobile-friendly with tabs at the bottom navigable with a swipe. Maybe Iâ€™m just not used to it, but I did find it clunky.</p>

<p>Live Text in the camera is pretty cool, but again, nothing groundbreaking that you havenâ€™t seen before. It includes â€˜Visual Look Up,â€™ which is basically Google Lens.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a tonne of updates for health, but Iâ€™ll have to cover them later when Iâ€™ve had a chance to play with them.</p>

<h2 id="ipados-15">iPadOS 15</h2>

<p>I like Multitasking in iPadOS 15. Finally, it doesnâ€™t look like Windows 8! The home screen and widgets have been updated so that widgets do feel like theyâ€™re fully integrated instead of shoved to the side as they were with iPadOS 14.x</p>

<p>I think my very favorite feature is the new â€˜Quick Noteâ€™, where you can swipe up from the corner and get a little popup note that allows you to make a quick note with your finger or a pencil. Notes are synced across your devices and linked to websites so that you can connect a note with content on the page. (Long ago, I worked on a Windows 8 launch app called â€˜strandsâ€™ that did this, but it didnâ€™t make it to the Windows 8 launch, so lovely the see the idea re-used!)</p>

<p>Another excellent update is Swift Playgrounds now on iPad! Yes, you can write code in SwiftUI with code completion and previewâ€¦.and you can submit your apps straight to the app store! Yes, your iPad is now a developer tool!</p>

<p>If youâ€™re using macOS Monterey, you can even work across devices â€“ with your mouse/trackpad from your macOS device being usable on your iPad â€“ giving you an authentic second-screen experience! Iâ€™m going to play with that one and report back! :)</p>
