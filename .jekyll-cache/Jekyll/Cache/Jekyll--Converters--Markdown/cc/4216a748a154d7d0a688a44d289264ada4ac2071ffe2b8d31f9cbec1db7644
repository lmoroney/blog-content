The Covid-19 pandemic has been (hopefully) a once-in-a-lifetime experience. My heart goes out to countries that are still suffering, but Iâ€™m super encouraged by the progress we have made in the USA.</p>

<p>I have been volunteering regularly at vaccination clinics, and itâ€™s been a privilege to be a part of the solution. I wanted to share some stats that I got from Seattle city today in a Thank you note!</p>

<p>About 76% of our eligible population has had one vaccine, with 60% being fully vaccinated, so weâ€™re approaching â€˜herdâ€™ immunity, and Seattle may fully re-open sooner than previously expected.</p>

<p>The vaccination clinic at Lumen field (home of the Seattle Seahawks) administered over 97,000 vaccinations, and people of color were approximately 40% of those served.</p>

<p>The mass clinics are closing down in the middle of June, and the strategy will change to smaller, localized ones.</p>

<p>If you havenâ€™t had your shot(s), please get them. The sooner we are all immunized, the sooner we are safe and can move on.</p>

<p>My last volunteering day was on Tuesday. Hereâ€™s a picture with my daughter!</p>
