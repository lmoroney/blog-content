<p>Youâ€™ve probably seen lots of short movies being made using AI tools, and youâ€™ve wondered how theyâ€™re done. Well, hereâ€™s an example of one, and Iâ€™m going to document the process of how it was made, and while going through that, also highlight the <em>limitations</em> of the technology that lead to many of these movies looking the same.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the movie</p>

<p>Itâ€™s kinda cool, and it tells a story. But once youâ€™ve seen a few movies like this, youâ€™ll begin to see similar stuff in them, and where the moviemaker is working around the challenges.</p>

<p>The big ones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coherence: When using AI generation to create things, getting the same things in multiple pictures is difficult. Notice how the city and spaceship changes, for example.</li>
  <li>Clip length: Generally services that create AI video will give you 3-4 seconds of video. Go longer, and youâ€™ll see them rapidly degenerate. So, your â€˜movieâ€™ will be a sequence of 3-4 second clips.</li>
  <li>Character interaction: Youâ€™ll often see single characters in poses with the camera moving around them. Thatâ€™s what current generation technology is effectively limited to. You might have people facing each other down, but you wonâ€™t see a lot of having characters interact</li>
  <li>Dialog: When using AI generated video, you canâ€™t yet synch it with dialog. Not yet anyway!</li>
</ul>

<p>With that in mind, and knowing these restrictions, I wanted to create a short movie.</p>

<p>Thus â€“ I needed to string several scenes together and make a story out of them. One trick I could use is multiple shots of the same person with a similar prompt description, to embue a sense of drama. I chose to have a girl in a sci fi setting. Thereâ€™s always something about looking at something huge from a distance that enthralls me.</p>

<h3 id="scene-1-a-melancholy-futuristic-moment">Scene 1: A melancholy futuristic moment</h3>

<p>So, I started with midjourney, and this prompt:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a long shot of a young asian woman standing on a cliff overlooking a sci fi city far below. 
Sunny day. Science Fiction planet. She wears a black and red sci fi uniform in the style of modern anime, 
realistic rendering of the human form, action and sci fi oriented, --ar 7:3 --niji 6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it gave me this set of images:
<img src="/assets/midj1.png" alt="First scene" /></p>

<p>Theyâ€™re pretty good, but not quite what I was going for, although the one on the lower left is excellent. So I tried again, tweaking the prompt slightly:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a medium shot of a young asian woman standing on a cliff overlooking a sci fi city far below. 
Sunny day. Science Fiction planet. She wears a black and red sci fi uniform in the style of modern anime, 
realistic rendering of the human form, action and sci fi oriented, --ar 7:3 --niji 6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty much just asking for a medium shot:
<img src="/assets/midj2.png" alt="Second attempt at first scene" /></p>

<p>I really like the one on the upper right. Itâ€™s more a long shot, and less a medium shot, but the idea of someone looking from a distance at a far off place had the sense of melancholy and futurism I was looking for. Perfect!</p>

<h3 id="scene-2-introducing-our-main-character">Scene 2: Introducing our main character</h3>

<p>Ok, now weâ€™ve seen her from the back, letâ€™s take a look at our main characterâ€™s face. Now we should be closer, and her face â€“ and any emotion present on it, should be the focus of the next shot. So I tried this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a full body shot of a young asian woman wearing a black and red sci fi uniform in the style of modern anime, 
sunny day, blue skies behind, realistic rendering of the human form, action and sci fi oriented, --ar 7:3 --niji 6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I got some really nice results back right away:
<img src="/assets/midj3.png" alt="First set of results for full body shot" /></p>

<p>I really like the drama of the second and third images. Thereâ€™s something about the expression on her face. Originally I wanted a pure anime vibe, so the first image was interesting, but after a few attempts on step 3 to see if I could get more of this character, it failed to give me something that satisfied me! So I went back to the more CGI look and feel of images 2 and 3, ultimately deciding on the third one, because I like how the low angle shot embues a lot of emotion.</p>

<p>Now that I have the first intro to my MC, I wanted another shot of her, a little closer, and maybe lit a little differently to give a sense of rising drama.</p>

<h3 id="scene-3-getting-deeper-into-our-mcs-feelings">Scene 3: Getting deeper into our MCâ€™s feelings</h3>

<p>Hereâ€™s where one can hit coherence challenges. When asking the engine to render â€˜a young asian woman,â€™ thereâ€™s a lot of variety. If I want another shot of the same girl, itâ€™s going to be tough. But I had a theory I wanted to follow, and it was pretty much brute force. Keep going until I find one thatâ€™s close, and then use â€˜variationsâ€™ to get closer. So I edited the former prompt a little â€“ asking for a close-up, as opposed to a full body shot, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a close up of a young asian woman wearing a black and red sci fi uniform in the style of modern anime, 
sunny day, blue skies behind, realistic rendering of the human form, action and sci fi oriented, --ar 7:3 --niji 6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/midj4.png" alt="A closeup on my MC" /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll agree that the results are beautiful. My favorite is #3, itâ€™s such a gorgeous shot, but it doesnâ€™t fit my needs. The fourth one is also stunning, and reminds me somewhat of a younger version of <a href="https://thetvdb.com/series/the-expanse/people/65335768">Florence Faivre, of â€˜The Expanseâ€™ fame</a>. Not a bad thing!</p>

<p>But ultimately #1 was closest in look and feel to my original image, and using the â€˜variationsâ€™ control in Midjourney, I thought Iâ€™d reroll to see if I can can another look and feel that Iâ€™d prefer:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/midj5.png" alt="Using variations to improve on my second shot of my MC" /></p>

<p>These were all terrific, but I ultimately settled on the fourth image, as I liked the lighting on the side of her face. The third wasnâ€™t bad either, but from experience, I found that when turning images into video, having more hair visible makes it a bit more dramatic, so that was the tiebreaker!</p>

<h3 id="scene-4-adding-drama">Scene 4: Adding Drama</h3>
<p>Ok, now I have a couple of shots of my main character, and sheâ€™s somewhat coherent. Iâ€™ve gotten over one of the main problems with this stuff. But now, as well as poses, I need a story. I had the idea for this story to take a turn to make it interesting. Instead of her lamenting the destruction of the civilization we saw in the first shot, wouldnâ€™t it be nice if she was celebrating it instead? So for that, I wanted two more shots. One, a closeup of her eye looking at the destruction, and the other a variation of the shot from scene 3 with the dramatic lighting of flames etc. So, Iâ€™ll start with the latter.</p>

<p>With MidJourney, you can start from an existing image by providing its URL, which you can get by opening the image full screen, right clicking, and selecting â€˜Copy Image Addressâ€™. Enter it at the beginning of the prompt, and then enhance that with your desired updates.</p>

<p>So I started with the closeup from the previous shot, and gave the URL of that image in the prompt, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;https://s.mj.run/Z5fF0z68gkc&gt; bathed in the orange glow of flames, an evil smile on her face --ar 7:3 --niji 6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And I got these results:
<img src="/assets/midj6.png" alt="Relighting my character" /></p>

<p>While theyâ€™re a little more anime, and a little less CGI than the previous shot, they all look great. #3 is perhaps a little too evil! I liked #4 because, again, the eyes tell an interesting story, and kinda reflect the twist I wanted at the end.</p>

<p>Finally, I needed a closeup on her eyes. This one was trickier than I expected, and I had to reroll and go through variations a number of times until I got something that told the story I wanted:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>an extreme close up of the eyes a young asian woman wearing a black and red sci fi uniform in the style of modern CGI anime, 
sunny day, blue skies behind, reflection of a sci fi city in her eyes, action and sci fi oriented, --ar 7:3 --niji 6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I particularly like that even through I didnâ€™t ask for the city to be in flames, it gave me one!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/midj7.png" alt="My character's eye in closeup" /></p>

<h3 id="scenes-5-and-onwards-the-alien-invasion">Scenes 5 and onwards, the alien invasion</h3>

<p>This part was relatively easy because it didnâ€™t involve a human character. We can be more forgiving if the spaceships and city looks different, and I can write around that â€“ talking about the destruction of an entire civilization, so diversity in image is a strength, so I got a bunch of prompts like these, to create the scenes:</p>

<p>Before the attack</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a high tech sci fi city in the style of modern CGI anime, sunny day, blue skies, 
a dark, ugly, spaceship hovering over it, contrasting the beauty of the city. 
Action and Sci-Fi oriented. --ar 7:3 --niji 6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After the attack</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a high tech sci fi city burning. Flames everywhere torching each of the buildings. 
In the style of modern CGI anime, sunny day, blue skies. 
Action and Sci-Fi oriented. --ar 7:3 --niji 6 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the variations on these, I was able to grab a few frames. I now had a number of frames that storyboarded my movie. The next part would be to animate them, and Iâ€™ll talk about that in the next post. But first, hereâ€™s how the 8 frames tied together into a storyboard, and we can begin to see a story emerge from them:</p>
