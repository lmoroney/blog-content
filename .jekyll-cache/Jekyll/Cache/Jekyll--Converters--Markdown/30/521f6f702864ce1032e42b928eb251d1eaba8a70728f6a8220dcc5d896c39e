I";<p>I’m incredibly passionate about teaching and ecstatic that in the last few years, I have been able to scale to millions of students via MOOC platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udacity.</p>

<p>This page lists the major courses I have worked on, and I hope you can find something interesting to learn from them.</p>

<p>I’m always interested in new teaching opportunities at Universities. If you’re looking for a guest lecturer or adjunct professor, please email me!</p>
