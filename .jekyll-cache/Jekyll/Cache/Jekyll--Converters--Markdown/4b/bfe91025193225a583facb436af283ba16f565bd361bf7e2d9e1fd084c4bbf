I"É<p>Iâ€™m excited to announce the launch of my latest Massively Open Online Course (or MOOC) called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/google-ai-for-anyone">Google AI for Anyone</a>, created with the lovely folks from HarvardX and EdX.</p>

<p>The goal of this course, as its name suggests, is to be a broad introduction of what AI is (and perhaps more importantly, what it isnâ€™t)  designed for everybody to enjoy!</p>

<p>No engineering, no programming, no math required.</p>

<p>The course will begin with an introduction to what AI is all about and understand where it stands in the hype cycle. Iâ€™ll demonstrate examples where common conceptions about AI are wrong and how we can easily fall into fear about the possibilities instead of being encouraged by the opportunities.</p>

<p>Through understanding the hype lifecycle and getting to the point of understanding the realities of AI, weâ€™ll also look at examples where people followed the curve and became productive. Iâ€™ll share a fun anecdote of how the actor <a href="https://twitter.com/dhewlett">David Hewlett</a> of <em>Stargate</em> fame broke through the hype and came up with some great innovative ideas for using AI in his industry!</p>

<p>Using the examples of games, medicine, self-driving cars, and others, weâ€™ll dig into how people build AI systems using data. If youâ€™re interested in building AI models, I have other courses and books to help!</p>

<p>If you want, once youâ€™ve gained a high-level understanding of how AI and Machine Learning work, weâ€™ll also go a little lower and explore the anatomy of an artificial neuron and how itâ€™s just a simple mathematical function. When these functions work together similarly to biological neurons, exciting things can happen!</p>

<p>The course will wrap up with a discussion about the ethics of AI systems, particularly when used to make important decisions about peopleâ€™s lives, and a roundup of some of the tools that will help you avoid mistakes!</p>

<p>You can access the course on edX today!</p>
