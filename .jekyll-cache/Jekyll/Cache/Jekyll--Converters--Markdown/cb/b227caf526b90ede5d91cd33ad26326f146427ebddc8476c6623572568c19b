<p>A few days back, I wrote this <a href="https://laurencemoroney.com/2024/01/27/materials.html">blog post</a>, covering a passion of mine – how AI can be used to change things that we use every day, and while so doing, improving costs, efficiency, and reducing waste, giving an overall positive impact on society and environment.</p>

<p>And then I turned it into a video like this!</p>

<p>This was achieved using a service caled VEED, that I discovered via their ChatGPT plugin called ‘Video GPT by VEED’. And while I didn’t use that tool to create this video, it struck my that by creating that custom GPT, they improved their discovery, and won me as a customer.</p>

<p>VEED gives you an in-browser video creation and editing tool with all the basic bells and whistles you’d expect like a timeline editor.</p>

<p>Where it <em>shines</em> is in its use of AI to provide services above and beyond. Some examples of this are</p>

<ul>
  <li>The AI-Generated Avatar. The news reader in the above video is entirely AI generated – or at least her lip sync is!</li>
  <li>Automated subtitles, including emphasis words</li>
  <li>And my current favorite – translation!</li>
</ul>

<p>Explore them here in Cantonese and Japanese:</p>
