I"ª<p>A few tips to explore how to build a better resume. This advice wonâ€™t guarantee you to pass any tech interview, but many common pitfalls cause people to fail. As always, free advice is seldom cheap, so this might involve you spending quite a bit of effort! :)</p>

<h2 id="keywords-and-filtering">Keywords and Filtering</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s start with the first and most obvious one: Your resume or CV.</p>

<p>When applying to large companies, thereâ€™s often an automated system that processes your application. Often these use keyword matching to â€˜scoreâ€™ your resume as being appropriate to a job. Hiring managers have limited time, and they canâ€™t read <em>every</em> resume, so an initial automated triage is required. As such, you <em>must read the job description</em> and make sure that your resume is keyword-heavy, matching the job description.</p>

<p>If it asks for somebody who has senior-level knowledge in Kotlin, you canâ€™t say that you have equivalent knowledge in Java and have the machine understand that! So, while you cannot put every iota of your abilities on a 1-2 page resume, you <em>should</em> tailor it to a specific job application, making it keyword heavy.</p>

<p>So, for example, if theyâ€™re looking for a mobile developer who knows the backend, and youâ€™re primarily a backend developer who knows mobile, be sure to tailor the resume to be heavier on your mobile background.</p>

<p>This brings me to the next point</p>

<h2 id="dont-lie">Donâ€™t lie</h2>
<p>It might be tempting to pad your stats, lie about abilities, fake some experience or education, or something else while tailoring your resume. Donâ€™t do this. You WILL get caught, and the <em>best</em> that could happen is that they reject and forget you, and you just wasted your time and energy. Also, tech is a smaller community than you might think, and news <em>does</em> get around. If you canâ€™t be honest on a resume, you canâ€™t be honest on the job, and it will hurt you in the long run. And if someone tells you â€˜everybody does it,â€™ donâ€™t listen to them!</p>

<h2 id="education-is-important-but-not-essential">Education is important, but not essential</h2>
<p>I get many questions about â€˜Do I need an MS or Ph.D.?â€™, and the simple answer is â€˜it depends. Every job is different. Read the requirements closely. Thereâ€™s usually a â€˜minimumâ€™ and a â€˜preferredâ€™ set of qualifications. If youâ€™re somewhere close to these, go ahead and be confident that youâ€™re ok. Often they will say â€˜â€¦or equivalent experienceâ€™, which is your opportunity to show what you can do <em>beyond</em> education. I find that type of wording is more common nowadays.</p>

<p>While putting education on your resume, you donâ€™t need to be exhaustive. Listing every class you did makes it hard to read. Simply tell the degree, the school, the date granted, and any particular things youâ€™d like to call out. For example, if you did a significant project that matches the type of thing theyâ€™re looking for in the job, call that out! But you are wasting resume space by listing every single class :)</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-ability-is-easier-than-ever-take-advantage-of-this">Proof of ability is easier than ever. Take advantage of this!</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s easy nowadays for you to <em>show</em> that you can do the job. You can blog, post to YouTube, open-source code on GitHub, enter coding competitions, get rankings, and so much more. When I read a resume, this is the <em>first</em> thing I will look at before education or experience. Itâ€™s free, easy to do, and you donâ€™t have to be in the top charts. Thereâ€™s another hidden bonus here â€“ often, tech interviews will have tech questions. If you have code in your GitHub, I think most tech interviewers would prefer to ask about that instead of coming up with hypothetical scenarios. So now, youâ€™re speaking from a position of strength!</p>

<p>â€¦which brings me to the next point:</p>

<h2 id="dont-lie-about-code">Donâ€™t Lie about Code</h2>
<p>Just like lying on a resume, donâ€™t put other peopleâ€™s code in your GitHub and try to pass it off as your own. If youâ€™re asked about what is supposed to be YOUR CODE and have no deep idea what it does, you WILL get caught. Write your own code, or extend other peopleâ€™s code, but put your work down as your work, and donâ€™t take from someone else!</p>

<p>Finally, find a good friend who will be honest with you and who will tear your resume apart, finding flaws so that you can fix them! :)</p>
