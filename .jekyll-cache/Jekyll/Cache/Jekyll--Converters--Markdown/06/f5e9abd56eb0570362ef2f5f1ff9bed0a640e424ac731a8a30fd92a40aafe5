I"#<p>I’m often asked about how to get started in the field of Artificial Intelligence. First, it’s important to understand what you’re asking. What <em>is</em> AI? Why should you be interested?</p>

<p>At my talk for Google IO 2023, I made a quick video to give you the lay of the land. What it is, why you should care, and what it’s all about to get data, train models, deploy and manage them.</p>

<p>The goal is to give you a good understanding in a short timeframe – so it’s just a few minutes to hopefully at least give you enough info to start asking all the right questions!</p>
