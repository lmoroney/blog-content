I just discovered this video and had forgotten about it! Itâ€™s a fun interview with Doctor Kevin Webster of Imperial College in London, talking about TensorFlow 2.  Amongst other things, we discuss my unlikely start in AI, way back in 1992!</p>

<p>This was filmed as part of the TensorFlow 2 specialization from Imperial College, which I strongly recommend you check out if you want to learn AI and ML!</p>

<p>You can watch it <a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/getting-started-with-tensor-flow2/interview-with-laurence-moroney-vB43N">here</a></p>
