<p>I wrote a trilogy of books over 15 years ago called â€˜The Fourth Worldâ€™, â€˜The Million Year Journeyâ€™ and â€˜The Legend of the Locustâ€™</p>

<p>There were really popular with hundreds of thousands of readers, and they tell an epic tale that starts innocently enough, but rapidly becomes an existential and epic story about the past, present, and future of humanity.</p>

<p>I re-read them while on vacation a few months back and fell in love with the characters all over again.</p>

<p>But they needed a <em>serious</em> copyedit, so I did a thorough revision, and now, they are re-released, as a compilation called <a href="https://amzn.to/4edB3ec">â€˜Locust Magicâ€™ available on Kindle Unlimited for Free!</a></p>

<p>Please check them out, and let me know what you think! :)</p>
