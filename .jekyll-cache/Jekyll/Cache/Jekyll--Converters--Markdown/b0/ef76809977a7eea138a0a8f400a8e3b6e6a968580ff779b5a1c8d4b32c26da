I"Ô<p>So I took the plunge and bought one of the famous $19 Cleaning Cloths from Apple.</p>

<p>This much maligned and lampooned cloth is actually quite nice. Letâ€™s take a look.</p>

<p>It arrives in letterbox packaging like this.</p>

<p>Apple make great products, and they fully understand that the packaging is part of the experience. If youâ€™ve ever spent time in Asia, itâ€™s a very asian thing. Your moments of delight start right at the first glance and touch on the product. Thatâ€™s what theyâ€™ve done here. It feels nice and sturdy. It has a pull tag at the bottom thatâ€™s labeled with a little green arrow that you can peel to open the package.</p>

<p>You tear and unfold to see this. Simple. Elegant. Almost cute.</p>

<p>Remove the cloth and youâ€™ll see that the cloth is folded in half, and is roughly square in shape. It has a very nice embossed monogram.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a closer look at the monogram and the cloth itself. Itâ€™s much sturdier than I originally thought, and I can so see myself using this to clean my MacBook pro.</p>

<p>Now people might mock spending $19 on a cloth, and if it were just a cloth, I might agree. To be fair, itâ€™s a super premium one, and instead of paying 10x what you should pay, itâ€™s probably more like 2x.</p>

<p>I kinda like it.</p>

<p>But, the compatibility list online is definitely worth a little mockery!</p>

<p>You can find the cloth <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth">here</a> â€“ and be sure to check the compatibility list to see if the cloth will work for you! For example, it wonâ€™t work on my 2011 iMac. But enquiring minds want to know â€“ if I try to clean it with this cloth, will it break the cloth, or will it break the iMac???</p>
