<p>Courseraâ€™s Global Industry Skills Report of 2021 has been released, and it contains some excellent insights into the skills of tomorrow. You can download it for yourself <a href="https://www.coursera.org/skills-reports/global">here</a>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been clear for some time that a digital transformation is underway, and that the skills to succeed in tomorrowâ€™s will be vastly different than those of today. Iâ€™ve personally had the mission to grow the number of AI-savvy people to help bootstrap that transformation, but Iâ€™m amazed by how accelerated the growth has been.</p>

<p>If you take nothing else from the report, take this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fig1.png" alt="Figure showing job growth from 41M in 2020 to 190M in 2025" /></p>

<p>Digital jobs in 2020 were around 41M. By 2025, just 4 years from now, theyâ€™ll be at 190M.</p>

<p>The growth is almost 3.5x over 5 years, which is unprecedented! Not only that, it predicts that of those 149M new jobs, <em>98 Million</em> will be in Software Development <em>and</em> a further 20 Million will be in Data Analysis, Machine Learning and AI.</p>

<p>Much of this comes from research into digital transformation that was conducted by Microsoft showing that two years worth of transformation was concentrated into 2 months because of lockdown.</p>

<p>In short â€“ the digital and AI future is arriving early.</p>

<p>When exploring the report, youâ€™ll see, across the board that every sector is projecting massive increases in Software Development roles in particular, leading to the 98M total new jobs.</p>

<p>So, thereâ€™s never been a better time to get into Software Development, or to refresh your current skills if you are a developer.</p>

<p>The top desired skills vary by dimain, but many of them have free tutorials on Coursera and elsewhere. Some Iâ€™d like to call out are:</p>
