I"%<p>After a late scratch, they asked me to quickly create a talk for Google IO on getting started with cross-platform mobile Machine Learning. So, one Saturday morning, at a Starbucks in Mercer Island, Washington, I came up with a quick talk on how to do Cross-Platform Computer Vision. It’s a short video – about 12 minutes, but it will cover the basics of creating a Computer Vision model that recognizes different things and how to deploy it to mobile systems. I’ve included Python code for model building, Kotlin code to run it on Android, and Swift Code for iOS!</p>
