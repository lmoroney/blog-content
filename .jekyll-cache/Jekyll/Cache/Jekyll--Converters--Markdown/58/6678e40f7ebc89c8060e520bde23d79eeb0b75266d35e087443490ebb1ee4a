<p>Coursera’s Global Industry Skills Report of 2021 has been released, and it contains some excellent insights into the skills of tomorrow. You can download it for yourself <a href="https://www.coursera.org/skills-reports/global">here</a>.</p>

<p>The primary point that caught my eye is the top of page 4, where they show the growth of Digital jobs from 41M in 2020 to 190M in 2025.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fig1.png" alt="Figure showing job growth from 41M in 2020 to 190M in 2025" /></p>

<p>The growth is almost 3.5x over 5 years, which is unprecedented! Not only that, it predicts that of those 149M new jobs, 98 Million will be in Software Development <em>and</em> a further 20M will be in Data Analysis, Machine Learning and AI.</p>

<p>Much of this comes from research into digital transformation that was conducted by Microsoft showing that two years worth of transformation was concentrated into 2 months because of lockdown. In short – the digital and AI future is arriving early.</p>

<p>When exploring the report, you’ll see, across the board that every sector is projecting massive increases in Software Development roles in particular, leading to the 98M total new jobs.</p>

<p>So, there’s never been a better time to get into Software Development, or to refresh your current skills if you are a developer.</p>

<p>The top desired skills vary by dimain, but many of them have free tutorials on Coursera and elsewhere. Some I’d like to call out are:</p>
