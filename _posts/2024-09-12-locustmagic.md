## Locust Magic

![Locust Magic Cover](/assets/locustmagic-cover.jpeg)

I wrote a trilogy of books over 15 years ago called 'The Fourth World', 'The Million Year Journey' and 'The Legend of the Locust'

There were really popular with hundreds of thousands of readers, and they tell an epic tale that starts innocently enough, but rapidly becomes an existential and epic story about the past, present, and future of humanity. 

I re-read them while on vacation a few months back and fell in love with the characters all over again. 

But they needed a *serious* copyedit, so I did a thorough revision, and now, they are re-released, as a compilation called ['Locust Magic' available on Kindle Unlimited for Free!](https://amzn.to/4edB3ec) 

Please check them out, and let me know what you think! :)
