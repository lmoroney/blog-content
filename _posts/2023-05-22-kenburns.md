I really love the combination of the 'Ken Burns' effect to bring images to life, with a way to cut the image up into layers, and then move each layer separately.

It's usually a lot of work in photoshop. 

But now, with the amazing work from [Simon Niklaus et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05483), it seems that ML models can perform this task by using segmentation to figure out foreground from background and inpainting to fill in the missing pixels.

It's ingenious.

I played with the image from above, and got this:


<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hC6Ie4XTa-s" 
frameborder="0" 
allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
allowfullscreen></iframe>

Still a bit of work to be done, and I'm hoping I can tweak for higher resolution in the video, but the effect is definitely stunning...considering it's entirely automated!
