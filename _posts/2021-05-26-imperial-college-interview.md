I just discovered this video and had forgotten about it! It's a fun interview with Doctor Kevin Webster of Imperial College in London, talking about TensorFlow 2.  Amongst other things, we discuss my unlikely start in AI, way back in 1992!

This was filmed as part of the TensorFlow 2 specialization from Imperial College, which I strongly recommend you check out if you want to learn AI and ML!
