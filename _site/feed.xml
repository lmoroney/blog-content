&lt;p&gt;In this article, I’m going to use MidJourney. Previous chapters used DALL-E. Let me know what you think twitter.com/lmoroney&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;launch&quot;&gt;Launch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We should always reach for the sky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the very beginning of history, our ancestors were looking up and wondering what was beyond their reach. The stars were calling them. They weaved stories of gods and angels, but behind them all was the intense desire to be out there. A desire born of an instinct for survival.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of a girl looking at the stars from the african savannah&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s something we’ve forgotten as we’ve become civilized. We’ve become comfortable in our homes, our cities and our countries. We’ve defeated nature and haven’t had the same worries that they had. But we lost something in that complacency, I fear. And now, as our world gets overcrowded, as our environment collapses under us, we need to rediscover it. We need to look up, and not worry about tripping as we race towards a new destiny. We will be those gods and angels if we want to. And you can be one of them, if you just keep trying, and never give up…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha looking out the windows of the hotel towards the spaceport&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE SPACE ELEVATOR. Its relatively simple name belied the sheer scale of it. Craning her neck, Aisha looked up as it disappeared impossibly into the deep blue sky. The ‘shuttle’ was a box-like structure that could easily pass for another building, but for the rocket boosters placed on its corners. These boosters would provide the initial ‘launch’ to get the craft moving out of its gravitational inertia. After that, the rotation of the Earth would take over and drive the shuttle up the cable into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of a space elevator viewed from orbit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was so glad for last night’s dinner with Mother. Beforehand, it had felt like there was a tension building between them. Mother’s basking in her status had gotten under Aisha’s skin, and she had been worried that she might blow up at her before leaving. She was worried that she might end up regretting it, but there was only so long she could bite her tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of a Aishas mother watching the shuttle in the distance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She almost thanked the reporter for his rude question. It had brought them closer together. She felt a pang of pride again at Mother’s words that she had done exactly what Father would have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the same reporter had wrestled his way to the front of the audience, and was barking out questions to the cadets as they boarded the shuttle. She was happy she knew where he was, so she could actively ignore him as she passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave Mother one final hug, and turned and walked along the long ramp up to the shuttle. With every step away from her, Aisha felt more and more alone. As the entrance loomed toward her, she felt the urge to turn and run back to Mother’s welcoming arms. Mother would hold her and protect her, and to heck with anyone who would criticize her for not going through with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of the spaceport on a hawaiian island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She continued step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the ramp, she turned for one more look back at the Earth. She caught Mother’s eye as she waved frantically, blowing kisses and smiling. “That’s my little girl!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She raised her hand to wave, hearing cameras popping, and returned the smile before turning to enter the shuttle. Her feet suddenly felt heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was really going through with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was really leaving home and going into &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each step seemed to be a chore, doubt and indecision weighing on her more heavily than gravity ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step-by-step she continued forward. The entrance lobby curved away from the door, and in a few moments, the daylight was lost. Words she had learned from history came back to her. Alea iacta est. She smiled, thinking that her Classics teacher would be proud of her. The die is cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of the entrance lobby of a space elevator shuttle, windows overlooking to ocean beyond&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior of the shuttle was clearly designed to impress and soothe its occupants. Instead of the functional ships of yesteryear, it was all polished chrome and intricately-designed surfaces. In the days of rocket travel to the stars, every ounce of payload had to be carefully measured, with no room for luxury, as propelling something into orbit required enormous amounts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Elevator changed all that, so designers of spacecraft were free to allow their occupants to be comfortable with traveling into space. This was also an important factor as many more people would leave the surface of the Earth – and a good, comfortable experience made it more tolerable, and thus less training was necessary. Indeed, Aisha had little more training than a couple of video tutorials explaining how to deal with weightlessness, and what to eat or not to eat prior to boarding. It was also good advice to use the bathroom before getting on the ship, for while facilities were available, using them in weightless conditions wasn’t optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She climbed stairs to the observation deck where she would spend most of the journey. The deck was a wide circle with multi story windows, and acceleration couches arranged facing outwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of the space elevator observation deck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we rise up the cable, the shuttle will spin slowly,” she had remembered the tutorial video telling her. “So pick any seat, and you’ll still be able to see everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha in an acceleration sofa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deck was terraced, so that seats near the back would still have a great view, and their occupants may not have the feeling of vertigo that those closer to the front would encounter. She picked one in the back row, next to an Asian girl who looked about Aisha’s age. The girl was intensely reading a book on her tablet, and didn’t look up as Aisha sat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha in an acceleration sofa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She suddenly spoke. “Aisha Parks, celebrity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha looked at her. “I’m not sure about that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl looked up, and her intense eyes searched Aisha’s. “Good to know,” she said finally, reaching a hand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Soo-Kyung Kim,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha meeting Soo-Kyung&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t need to tell you my name, I guess.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo-Kyung smiled. Her plain face lit up when she smiled. She was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So where are you from?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo-Kyung smiled again. “You haven’t heard of me? Good. I guess I am not a celebrity, either.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an odd answer, and from Soo-Kyung’s reaction, it was clear that Aisha’s confusion was written on her face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we are going to be good friends,” said Soo-Kyung. “I like how you are straightforward. I am too, but that intimidates some people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-11.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha and Soo-Kyung chatting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So where are you from?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am from a small village called Sijungho,” continued Soo Kyung. “There’s not much to see there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sounds Korean,” said Aisha. “You from South Korea?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“North Korea,” corrected Soo-Kyung. “I’ve never even been to South Korea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha felt her insides go cold. Against her will, she shuddered a little, and felt a sob begin to escape from her throat. Her father had died as a result of radiation sickness incurred in the second Korean War. And there was a North Korean girl here with her. Going into space with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She knew there was incredulity in her voice, but she couldn’t mask it. “Are you going to the Academy too?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” said Soo-Kyung. “And don’t worry, I’m as surprised as you are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s what you meant by celebrity?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It seems the media made as big a deal about me being the first North Korean as it did about you being the first African-American to go through open enrollment. It’s all a sham though, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m beginning to gather that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, when the Academy was first built, it was apparent that it was for the Elites, most of whom are from Western society, with a few Russians and Chinese thrown in to get funding. Nobody really knows who the students were, but it was typically those who would be in private elite schools on the surface, so being in space made little difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha thought about what Soo-Kyung was saying, and realized that she was right. Amazing that she had never thought of this herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Korean girl continued. “Now that they are all in place and established, it’s time to open it up to the rest of the world, so we can get their proverbial ‘sloppy seconds’, I guess.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s an academy,” said Aisha. “And we’re cadets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The cannon fodder, while they are the officers ordering us around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So why are you going through with it? Why am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; going through with it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo-Kyung shrugged. “Because it’s better than &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going through with it. Besides, there might be something great waiting for normal people like us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My father died in Korea,” said Aisha, surprising even herself at the change in subject. “But he always told my mother to tell me that I had a destiny. That the emerging age of space flight was one in which we must be free to explore the universe. He fought so that that freedom would still exist, so that I could do this. I can’t turn back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Most of my family died in the same war,” said Soo-Kyung. “But nothing ever really changed, did it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha realized that she must have sounded bitter, and the bitterness was reflected in Soo-Kyung’s answer. 
“I’m sorry,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No need,” said Soo-Kyung. “I’m glad that you are open and honest with me. Most people, particularly outside of my country, are not. They learn about where I’m from and think I need special treatment. I don’t. I’ve learned to stand on my own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had your strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t,” said Soo-Kyung, suddenly serious. “&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; kind of strength comes from trying to make a life in a country destroyed by nuclear war. You never want it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-12.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Soo-Kyung as a little girl in North Korea as nukes fall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we’re going into space, isn’t it? To make sure that wars like those will never put our species’ survival at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That would be nice,” said Soo-Kyung. “But if anything I think it will cause more wars and hardship before things get better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why?” 
“Because the only thing that stopped the entire world from burning during the war over my country was that it was the only world we have. If we discover more planets, livable ones, that will no longer be the case. And I want to be as far away from this world as possible before the next bombs fall.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Aisha could answer, the soft tone of the launch warning sounded. The rocket boost would be gentler than a typical aircraft take off, but safety protocols required that they be buckled into their crash seats in case anything went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She rolled her eyes and smiled, and strapped herself in. When everything was snug, she turned to look at Soo-Kyung. Their eyes met again, and Soo-Kyung bowed slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engines kicked in, and their seats lurched a little. From all around came the muffled sounds of the rockets roaring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the windows, Aisha could see the ground begin to slowly fall away. Within a few seconds the flotilla was no longer visible, and as they began to rise, she could see the entire outline of the nearby Kiritimati, where only yesterday they had landed. It felt like an eternity ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wondered how Mother felt, watching her shuttle rise slowly to the sky. As suddenly as they had begun, the rockets cut out, and there was another slight lurch as the inertia of the ship was stopped. She remembered the video training – this was the scariest part of the trip, where the shuttle, under normal gravity, could fall back to Earth and kill everyone aboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it didn’t, and the force on the Space Elevator started pushing them skyward, with ever-increasing speed. The horizon began to spin also, and as they rose up, she watched the island recede. Before long they were high enough to see that the horizon was curved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was it. This was for real. She was headed into space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space Cadets is the story of the first African American girl accepted into a prestigious space academy, and the story of discrimination, racism, and old-fashioned bullying she faces, and how she overcomes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s Chapter 2. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;press&quot;&gt;Press&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are so many things I’ve learned since I broke away from the cocoon that we call our country. It’s a great place, a safe place, but perhaps it’s because of that safety that we look inward. 
And in the case of too many people, we look backward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future dreams will never last if we always focus on the past. On the terrible things that were done to our ancestors. If we are to look forward, we should remember them, but not dwell on them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TERMINUS, THE MASSIVE flotilla that surrounded the Space Elevator, was too mobile to be called a city in its purest sense. But for all intents and purposes, it was one. Their hotel was the finest Aisha had ever slept in, with big, comfortable beds and a wonderful breakfast. The slight rocking of their room caused by the waves only further lulled her to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-2-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated image of The floating city called Terminus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was in fine cheer that she greeted the press conference, the crankiness of travel a distant memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, she was biting her lip, trying not to snap at the monotony and repetition of the questions that were largely irrelevant to her future as a space cadet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s it like being the first African-American to qualify through open enrollment?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s great, but I can’t really answer what it’s like until I go up there. But I’m looking forward to it, and hoping I can be an effective student.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She watched as the reporters took notes, unhappy with such a straightforward statement. There was no story there. “How do you think you are going to cope with the pressure?” “Until I know what the pressure is, it’s hard to answer that question. I’m sure I will handle it the same way as any other student.” One of the reporters, a white man whose hair was whiter than his skin, interrupted. “But you aren’t like the other students, are you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why would you say that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because you are the first African-American student to qualify through open enrollment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha could feel her anger rising. She tried to keep her calm as she answered evenly, “How does that make me different from the other students?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Please,” said the man. “We all see how &lt;em&gt;politically correct&lt;/em&gt; this situation is. There has been so much pressure on the board of governors to open enroll from amongst the general population so that we can meet &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; needs of diversity. So, of course, the first thing we need to do is to have some African-Americans amongst the student body. And while we’re at it, why don’t we get a girl, so we kill two proverbial birds with one proverbial stone. Let’s also find one who lost a father in the second Korean War! Isn’t it obvious to you that you have been picked for all of these reasons and that you are going into orbit to be in a place where you are likely to be out of your depth, but will probably be handled by kid gloves, so as to satisfy those who are bearing political pressures?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-2-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated image of Aisha at the press conference&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha felt her jaw drop. Even Mother was stunned into silence. The worst part, though, was that in a room full of people, many of whom were African-American, nobody leapt to her defense. Instead the press turned to her, recorders pointed in her direction, awaiting her answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a bunch of sharks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She could feel herself begin to sweat as all eyes turned her way. Time slowed to a crawl as they awaited an answer. With every passing tick, and nothing to say in response, she began to wonder if the man was right. If she really was out of her depth. If she really didn’t belong here, and she was just fooling herself. Maybe she wasn’t as smart or as capable as she thought she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would Father do in these circumstances? She had always learned of how great and how wise he was. Mother tried to pass down his teachings, but they were often through her filters, and Aisha was left to parse what the man had really been like, and what he would really do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She remembered one phrase: Never start the fight, but always finish it. The path was clear. There was a simple way to finish this fight. Composing herself as best she could, she smiled, and stood. It still felt like everything was moving in slow motion. Instead of exiting through the back, she took the steps down from the stage towards the waiting press, walking towards them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some began to get upset at her not answering the question. That was the news they had come for, and they smelled blood in the water. But she maintained her composure, looking straight ahead and walking slowly, step-by-step, as they parted before her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her path took her straight towards the reporter that had asked the question. His skin was turning redder now. Was it anger? Embarrassment? It didn’t matter. She met his gaze, held it for a moment. She watched him prepare for whatever she was going to say, saw his eyes dilate, his pallor flush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave him a little half-smile, and left the room to ever increasing volume and shouting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She finished the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her insides burning, she wanted to get as far away from the press room as possible. She had maintained a calm composure, but the man’s words bounced around her head, making her angrier with each passing step. 
But what if he was right? What if she really was chosen for the reasons he had said? She had to admit to herself that she had taken pride at being the first of her race to be chosen. And with there being so many qualified boys, that the first was a girl. Maybe she shouldn’t have felt so proud. Maybe she shouldn’t have let mother’s braggadocios attitude wear off on her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth of the matter was that she &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; selected. That she &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; going to be a space cadet. In a few hours, she would be in orbit: Working with the best and brightest people in the world, learning how to fly spaceships, and being part of the research team that was building ships that would go &lt;em&gt;to the stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This small-mindedness would be left behind. Whether or not he was right, she was still going to be part of that, and still going to have an opportunity to excel. Not as an African-American. Not as a girl. But as herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother was unhappy at dinner. Aisha wasn’t sure if it was because she had cut the press conference short or if it was because of what the man said. Not knowing her mother’s feelings disturbed her even more. Finally, Mother spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What you did,” she said. “Reminded me of your father. It was like he was back there in the room with me. I’ve never been more proud of you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha looked in her mother’s eyes. They were reddening. “It made me miss him all the more, and tonight you are leaving me too. I just realized how much I’ll miss you. It’ll be just me and your little brother now.” 
She stood up and walked round to Mother’s side of the table, embracing her warmly. She could feel Mother’s face on her shoulder, and the heat of her tears. Holding ever tighter, she felt the tears flow from her own face down Mother’s shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have to go,” she said. “I can stay with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother pushed her back. “No,” she said. “You can’t deny yourself this. You know your father fought hard so that we can enjoy our freedom, and some day that will be impossible on this planet. I think that day is coming sooner than we think. You are going to that station. You are going to excel. And you are going to the stars, and taking memories of me, and your father, and your brother with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She held Aisha tightly. “I just wish I could be with you, so that they won’t attack you again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They won’t, Mother. And you’ll always be with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, explore the sample size used. It’s over 73K developers. Then, understanding that there  are about 27M developers world wide, when running a statistical size calculator, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html?type=1&amp;amp;cl=99&amp;amp;ci=1&amp;amp;pp=50&amp;amp;ps=27000000&amp;amp;x=91&amp;amp;y=34&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see that for a survey to be 99% accurate, with a margin of error of only 1%, you need a sample size of around 17,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when browsing the responses, particularly the ‘Professional Developers’ tabs, you’ll see that in general there are 3x to 4x the number of people answering than would be required for 99% accuracy with a 1% error margin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;insights&quot;&gt;Insights:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;programming-languages---no-surprises&quot;&gt;Programming Languages - no surprises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most popular technologies section, 67.9% of developers say they used JavaScript. The programming language in second place was Python with 43.51% (in between was HTML/CSS and SQL, but I’m going to focus on more traditional coding languages here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sochart1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chart of top coding langauges&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That extrapolates to about &lt;em&gt;18 million&lt;/em&gt; JavaScript developers, and &lt;em&gt;12 million&lt;/em&gt; Python developers globally. Thus, as we build TensorFlow, these are the two main languages we support in developer documentation, education, etc. A surface of tens of millions of devs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ml-frameworks---the-widening-gap-between-tensorflow-and-pytorch&quot;&gt;ML Frameworks - the widening gap between TensorFlow and PyTorch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking into the ‘Other Frameworks and Libraries,’ one sees that 11.49% of Professional developers (i.e. about 3.1 Million) developers use TensorFlow, 7.61% (about 2M) use PyTorch and 6.47% (about 1.7M) use Keras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sochart2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chart of top frameworks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when it comes to &lt;em&gt;developers&lt;/em&gt; using ML Frameworks, TensorFlow is clearly the &lt;em&gt;most popular&lt;/em&gt; one, with about 50% more developers using it than PyTorch, and that’s not counting the Keras devs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear from the survey how many of them are TF users, but even in the &lt;em&gt;worst case scenario&lt;/em&gt;, where it would be zero of them — TensorFlow would still have &lt;em&gt;50% more developers than PyTorch&lt;/em&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;best case&lt;/em&gt;, where it would be all of them, then the population difference would be &lt;em&gt;more than double&lt;/em&gt;: 4.8M versus 2M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, those folks that talk about PyTorch “eating TensorFlow’s lunch” simply aren’t supported by the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And amongst the next generation of developers? 17.6% of ‘learners’ are using TensorFlow, 10.71% using Keras, and 10.68% using PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap is &lt;em&gt;widening&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sochart3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chart of top coding langauges being learned&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a diss to PyTorch. I openly share that I’m excited that there is optionality in the ML space. If there was only 1 player, I would be very wary. But there isn’t. Competition is good. But it’s pretty clear that the conversation around ‘dominant’ frameworks is misplaced at best, and heavily biased at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a big Kudos to the folks over at Hugging Face. With 1.92% of the respondents saying they use it, or bit more than half a million developers. That’s impressive for a brand new offering that’s specifically targeted to a particular scenario, as opposed to broad APIs like TensorFlow or PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loved-and-dreaded-frameworks-popularity-doesnt-translate-to-beloved&quot;&gt;Loved and Dreaded Frameworks: Popularity doesn’t translate to beloved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when one looks at the Loved/Dreaded section — Hugging Face Transformers was the most beloved with a split of 72.2% loved versus 27.76% dreaded. PyTorch had a split of 68.29:31.71, and TensorFlow did a bit worse with 60.06:39.94. We have some work to do to make it more beloved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note here though is the number of respondents and their statistical relevance. So, for example, the PyTorch split is based on only 3952 answers, so it’s not going to be quite the 99% with a 1% margin of error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sochart4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chart of loved frameworks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-potential-from-people-who-want---the-widening-accelerates&quot;&gt;Future potential from people who ‘want’ - the widening accelerates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most insightful part, particularly when surveying the overall landscape is to look at what developers &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this section, we see that 15.53% of developers want TensorFlow (from a survey of 53.442, so still well in the 99% with a 1% error margin), equating to a population of 4.19M developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a huge area of growth. The question was for those not already using it. So, if all of them to adopt, the TensorFlow developer community would grow from 3M to 7.19M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sochart5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chart of wanted frameworks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the PyTorch community would grow from 2M to 4.39M, and the HuggingFace Transformers one could almost double to 1M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s pretty clear — to me at least — the the ML framework community is vibrant, and that there are several players, the largest of which (by far!) is TensorFlow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t just take my word for it — the World Economic Forum’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Jobs_of_Tomorrow_2020.pdf&quot;&gt;report on the jobs of tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; only names 1 framework: TensorFlow, and only names 1 way of learning it: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice&quot;&gt;TensorFlow: In Practice specialization&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera!&lt;/p&gt;

I openly share that I’m excited that there is optionality in the ML space. If there was only 1 player, I would be very wary. But there isn’t. Competition is good. But it’s pretty clear that the conversation around ‘dominant’ frameworks is misplaced at best, and heavily biased at worst. Oh, and a big Kudos to the folks over at Hugging Face. With 1.92% of the respondents saying they use it, or bit more than half a million developers. That’s impressive for a brand new offering that’s specifically targeted to a particular scenario, as opposed to broad APIs like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Loved and Dreaded Frameworks: Popularity doesn’t translate to beloved Indeed, when one looks at the Loved/Dreaded section — Hugging Face Transformers was the most beloved with a split of 72.2% loved versus 27.76% dreaded. PyTorch had a split of 68.29:31.71, and TensorFlow did a bit worse with 60.06:39.94. We have some work to do to make it more beloved. One thing to note here though is the number of respondents and their statistical relevance. So, for example, the PyTorch split is based on only 3952 answers, so it’s not going to be quite the 99% with a 1% margin of error. Future potential from people who ‘want’ - the widening accelerates Perhaps the most insightful part, particularly when surveying the overall landscape is to look at what developers want Looking at this section, we see that 15.53% of developers want TensorFlow (from a survey of 53.442, so still well in the 99% with a 1% error margin), equating to a population of 4.19M developers. That’s a huge area of growth. The question was for those not already using it. So, if all of them to adopt, the TensorFlow developer community would grow from 3M to 7.19M. Similarly, the PyTorch community would grow from 2M to 4.39M, and the HuggingFace Transformers one could almost double to 1M. So, it’s pretty clear — to me at least — the the ML framework community is vibrant, and that there are several players, the largest of which (by far!) is TensorFlow. And don’t just take my word for it — the World Economic Forum’s report on the jobs of tomorrow only names 1 framework: TensorFlow, and only names 1 way of learning it: the TensorFlow: In Practice specialization on Coursera!

As such I’ve been sitting on the novel for years, and instead of leaving it to gather digital dust, I’m using it for an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online, illustrated, novel, with all of the illustrations using AI. Here’s part one, and I used DALL-E throughout to try to visualize some of the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want more, please reach out and let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;TRAINING&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT NEVER FAILED to give her a thrill when she saw the moonscape rush by underneath her ship, and the blue curve of Earth rise above it. Aisha smiled at its beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of Spaceship above the moon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down there, girls her age were wondering about homecoming dances, what dress they’d wear, or which boy would ask them out. She was much happier here, piloting her ship, zipping at breakneck speeds across the Moon, and getting ready to break into deep space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think I see them,” said David, her navigator, and co-pilot, sitting in one of the wing pods to her right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Two-seven-zero Karem one-nine-eight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Confirmed,” came the clipped voice of Soo-Kyung, her gunner. Aisha glanced to the pod on her left and her eyes met Soo-Kyung’s. The Korean girl smiled and nodded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha always wanted a visual confirmation. Comm lines could be hacked and voices faked. Soo-Kyung knew this instinctively. That’s what made them a great team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of a person flying a ship in VR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” said Aisha. “Weapons hot. Let’s check them out.” She punched in the coordinates, and the ship turned towards its target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Visual range in five seconds,” said David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see them,” Aisha replied. Her heads-up display started to light up with targets. Squares projected on her canopy, wrapping tiny dots that could easily be mistaken for stars to the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a lot of ships,” she said, awe sneaking into her voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a bloody awful lot of ships,” said David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of a person flying a ship in VR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo-Kyung was business as always. “Orders?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can you confirm ship type?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They are mostly type-three fighters. About eighty of them.” “What else?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A single mothership. That’s the target.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No other fighters?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A couple of type-ones, but hard to tell with all the movement.” The fighters were moving around the mothership, following what looked like random patterns, making it hard to get a radar lock. “Are they moving to intercept?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“David, probe the edge of their defense shield.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His gentle voice sounded in her earpiece. “Yes, Sir.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David took the ship forward slowly, while Soo-Kyung watched the behavior of the enemy fighters. They knew from experience that these ships could turn from defense to offense in the blink of an eye. If they didn’t react, they could find themselves surrounded and destroyed in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are at the edge of previous attack ranges,” said Soo-Kyung. “Recommend that we hold this position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship halted, and they floated in space, watching the enemy. “Any update on ship types, David?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of a spaceship hovering above the moon, alien ships in the background&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The best I got is maybe two or three type-ones, the rest are type-three.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wished she had read the spec books more closely but was glad David was there. “Turning radius of type-threes?” “Two hundred degrees,” he answered, almost in reflex. “Distance of fighters from the mothership?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Average about three hundred clicks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo-Kyung raised an eyebrow. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” “Yes,” said Aisha. “Full frontal assault, all shields on front.” “If we leave our back exposed–”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully they won’t get a chance. Maximum throttle, straight at the mothership, direct all energy to front shields.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Including lasers?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Including lasers. We’re on bullets and torpedoes. Can you do it?” She heard the smile in Soo-Kyung’s voice. “Done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good. And fire at will.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Roger.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“David. Punch course in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Course, aye.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Manual control to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Roger.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here goes nothing!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of a spaceship hovering above the moon, getting ready to fly into a cloud of enemy ships&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha punched the program, and she felt the craft lurch as they accelerated forward. She continued its burn, getting faster and faster as they approached the enemy ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ships turning to intercept.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Acknowledged.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She saw the enemy ships swarming to intercept. Suddenly their random patterns stopped, and they turned, almost as one, bearing down on her. They opened fire, but the forward shields held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Intercept in five seconds,” said Soo-Kyung. Aisha marveled at her ability to stay calm, and it seemed the more stressful the situation, the calmer she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like that, they flew through the squadrons of enemy fighters, on a course straight for the mothership. 
“They’re turning to intercept.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time seemed to slow down in her mind. The mothership approached weapons range at a painful crawl. The enemy fighters, now behind her, were slowly turning to follow them, with a clear shot at Aisha’s tail. She’d turned off their lasers, directing their energy to the shields, so they’d need to be close for ballistic weapons to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was going to be tight. Once the enemy fighters had turned around, the back of Aisha’s fighter was exposed. The lead ones had almost turned and were ready to open fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then Soo-Kyung had her target locked and opened up with everything she had on the mothership. Direct hits, but the ship stayed intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hit on their right-wing made the ship lurch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now would be a good time, Soo-Kyung.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha looked to her left, seeing her friend’s face deep in concentration. Another torpedo launched, hitting a module to the rear of the mothership’s bridge. A small explosion was followed by several large ones, but before the ship was destroyed, Aisha’s ship was hit again. This time right in the engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of an alien mothership hovering above the moon, with damage on its side&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha felt her ship lurch. Red lights were all over her console. The reactor had taken a direct hit. It was about to go critical. Her heart was beating hard. She reached for the eject buttons, hesitating long enough to see the mothership go up in a ball of flame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment’s hesitation was enough. She felt the ship lurch as the reactor gave out. Her mind slowed as the white flash enveloped them. She had enough time to realize, with resignation, that she was dead. Both co-pilots too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simulator door opened, and Captain Simms’ craggy face looked in at her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re dead. All of you. Again,” he said. Disapproval in his voice. “I thought you guys were better than that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-8.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of Virtual Reality simulators with teenage pilots training within&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-one&quot;&gt;PART ONE:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-letter-from-my-father&quot;&gt;A Letter From My Father&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;departures&quot;&gt;Departures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Dearest Aisha: 
I don’t even know how to begin writing this letter. I look at you now, sleeping in your crib, so small and so helpless, and I wish I could be there with you when you take your first steps. I wish I could see it when you get on the bus for your first day of school. I wish I could hold you when you come home crying for the first time, realizing that the world is a bigger and worse place than you could have ever imagined. 
But I won’t be. The disease that is tearing through my body will take me away from you soon. And I’m so very sorry. But, so that I won’t be a distant and mysterious memory, I’m writing you this letter. 
For you have a destiny. A bright and wonderful destiny…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE TRANSPORT PLANE was older and more rickety than she would have expected for one headed to the spaceport. Aisha peered out the window of the plane intently, waiting for her first glimpse of the great cable veering skyward from Kiritimati into the depths of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-9.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of a rickety airplane flying above polynesian islands&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It even had the old-school seats facing each other across a small table. A man sat there, and he was watching her closely. “It’s nothing really special,” he said. “You don’t see anything. It’s only interesting when a launch happens.” “How often?” she asked, knowing the answer already. She always knew the answer already, but she asked anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It depends,” he said, looking at his watch. “We build the shuttle onsite and then launch it. It’s not worth bringing it back to Earth, where it would burn up in the atmosphere, so it’s designed to be launched once, and then disassembled into different things to be used up there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pointed at the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m going up tomorrow,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded, smiling. “I figured. We get a lot of kids your age coming through here, heading for the Academy.” 
He smiled and went back to reading the news from his tablet. He hadn’t said anything about her color. Mother had insisted on telling everyone within earshot that Aisha was the first African-American to go to the Academy. And not only was she African-American, but she was also a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha groaned inwardly. She wished mother would just stop. It had been a couple of hours since they had left Hawaii. The plane flew south to the tiny atoll that Aisha couldn’t take her eyes off of. Upon arrival, they would take the short trip out to the bottom of the cable, and the fleet of ships imaginatively called Terminus. That would be the last stop before she launched into orbit, leaving Earth behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-10.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of the base of a space elevator in the polynesian islands&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man lowered his tablet and pointed to a silver dot on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a shuttle right there,” he said. “And if you look closely you can see the cable that makes up the Space Elevator.” Even the words sounded amazing to her. The Space Elevator. Since the invention of materials with the requisite strength in low enough density to make the concept buildable, many nations had gathered together to build this one. The idea was simple. Tether a cable on the Earth near the equator, and extend it out into space for about 35,000 kilometers. The object on the far end of the cable would then be in geostationary orbit, always above the same position on the Earth, much like communications or TV satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She peered, trying to make out the cable, but it was just too skinny to be seen from this distance – except for the occasional glint as the tropical sun reflected off it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the cable was tethered to the surface of the Earth, the rotation of the planet would send any object attached to the cable flying out from the center of gravity, propelling it into space. Once it reached the top of the cable, it could then launch itself outward, using a tiny fraction of the fuel that a traditional rocket launch would use up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-11.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of the cable of the space elevator reaching into the sky&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost overnight, it revolutionized space travel. One of the first things the international community had agreed upon was to build an academy. Its goal: To teach a new generation of humans what it would be like to have a single, coherent community, not hindered by the tropes of the past. Ultimately, such a community would be the future of mankind, its backers had argued, and would put an end to the wars that nearly destroyed us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-1-12.png&quot; alt=&quot;DALL-E Generated Image of the space elevator viewed from space&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha opened her locket and looked at his face, trying to remember him. Ravaged by cancers from radiation suffered in war, her father died before she reached her first birthday. He smiled back at her from the tiny picture, and she could see the pride in his smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did it, Dad. I made it into space, and I made sure that you would never be forgotten. That the next phase of humanity will have a little part of you in it. That was worth fighting for. I just wish you didn’t have to die for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plane jolted as it began to descend, waking Mother. “Are we there yet?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha smiled to herself. “We’re almost at the Terminus.” Mother smiled and looked at the man sitting across from Aisha. “She’s going to the Space Academy, you know,” she said, smiling. The man nodded. “You must be so proud.” 
“Oh, I am,” said Mother. “She’ll always be my little girl, but to be the first African-American, and one of the first girls up there, it’s so exciting.” “I’m sure,” said the man. “I think she’ll do amazing things.” “Aww, you’re so nice,” said Mother, milking the compliment for all it was worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said nothing and went back to reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irked, mother looked around for someone else to impress. The plane lurched again, so she closed her eyes instead, fighting back airsickness. Mother was never good at flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha turned back to the window, catching the man’s eye with his small smile. He nodded at her, and she returned the gesture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ground rushed at them, and with a jolt, they landed on the small airstrip. Since the construction of the Space Elevator had begun, this tiny island had changed from being a rock in the middle of the ocean to a thriving miniature city. But land was at a premium, so all passenger transport still came through the tiny airstrip on the western side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha had read that a new floating airport was under construction. When it opened, the island would be connected directly to the mainland of the USA and other countries, instead of needing a transport plane like this one flying out of Hawaii. 
As she got out of the plane, Aisha could feel the warm breeze and hear the crash of the surf. A rocky beach lay just to her right, within walking distance of the airstrip. Mother emerged, blinking in the bright light. A representative of the Academy greeted them and led them towards a small set of prefabricated buildings that served as the registration center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tiny look of disappointment crossed Mother’s face. Aisha rolled her eyes. Mother was probably expecting more press to meet them here, presumably not having enough of them in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only cadet on the arriving flight, Aisha strolled after the greeter, calling for Mother to keep up. The warm humid air felt good in her lungs. For the next few years she would be breathing processed air in the space station, so she wanted to make the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wondered if there would be time for the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administrative center was as plain on the inside as it was on the outside. A threadbare box, it housed several desks at which sat tired-looking administrators swiping through computer terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greeter read Mother’s disappointed gaze. “Here’s where we just make sure you are whom you say you are before taking the boat across to the Elevator. It helps us make sure that people don’t sneak aboard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother raised her eyebrows. “What kind of people sneak aboard? Terrorists? It doesn’t look like you could stop them!” The greeter smiled a little, and to Aisha, it looked practiced. “No terrorist could get within a thousand miles of this place. No, we’re more concerned about curious onlookers, too many relatives of cadets, that type of thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His words confused Aisha. How could a terrorist be stopped from getting here, when just about anybody could fly here, including too many family members? Was it all a front, or were they profiling everything about every person who even tried to come to this place? She held her tongue. If Mother thought there was any profiling going on, she’d launch into one of her rants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hear the hotel is very nice,” Aisha said, changing the subject. “Yes,” said the greeter. “We want your last night on planet Earth to be special.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But she’ll be coming back, for vacations and the like,” said Mother. “So it’s hardly her last night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course,” said the greeter, smiling, before ushering them to a desk where the clerk had finally booted up his screen. “You’re our last flight of the day today,” he said cheerfully. “But don’t worry - you aren’t the only launchie. The others are at the Terminus ahead of you, so you’ll have plenty of friends for the ride up.” Aisha smiled. She didn’t need friends, but it was best not to argue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah Miss Parks,” he continued, checking her credentials. “I heard you were coming today, it’s very nice to have you aboard.” “Thanks,” said Aisha. “But I just want to be like any other student.” “Yes,” he continued. “The media have made a big deal about it down here, but once you get up there, all that will be forgotten.” Mother piqued up. “What?” 
“We try to keep the kids insulated from political and social matters down on Earth,” he said in a trained voice. “That way they can focus on their work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But she is the first African-American to be accepted since open enrollment. Not only that, she’s one of the first girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes her very important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ma’am,” said the receptionist. “Your daughter is extremely important, and in time you’ll find it’s not for those reasons, but for who she is and what she’s capable of doing. Her race, her gender, those things don’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But she is the first African-American–”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man interrupted, albeit politely. “Of course,” he said. “And the press at Terminus will want to ask you all about that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

If they didn’t react, they could find themselves surrounded and destroyed in seconds. “We are at the edge of previous attack ranges,” said Soo-Kyung. “Recommend that we hold this position.” “Do it.” The ship halted, and they floated in space, watching the enemy. “Any update on ship types, David?” “The best I got is maybe two or three type-ones, the rest are type-three.” She wished she had read the spec books more closely but was glad David was there. “Turning radius of type-threes?” “Two hundred degrees,” he answered, almost in reflex. “Distance of fighters from the mothership?” “Average about three hundred clicks.” Soo-Kyung raised an eyebrow. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” “Yes,” said Aisha. “Full frontal assault, all shields on front.” “If we leave our back exposed–” “Hopefully they won’t get a chance. Maximum throttle, straight at the mothership, direct all energy to front shields.” “Including lasers?” “Including lasers. We’re on bullets and torpedoes. Can you do it?” She heard the smile in Soo-Kyung’s voice. “Done.” “Good. And fire at will.” “Roger.” “David. Punch course in.” “Course, aye.” “Manual control to me.” “Roger.” “Here goes nothing!” Aisha punched the program, and she felt the craft lurch as they accelerated forward. She continued its burn, getting faster and faster as they approached the enemy ships. “Ships turning to intercept.” “Acknowledged.” She saw the enemy ships swarming to intercept. Suddenly their random patterns stopped, and they turned, almost as one, bearing down on her. They opened fire, but the forward shields held. “Intercept in five seconds,” said Soo-Kyung. Aisha marveled at her ability to stay calm, and it seemed the more stressful the situation, the calmer she was. And just like that, they flew through the squadrons of enemy fighters, on a course straight for the mothership. “They’re turning to intercept.” Time seemed to slow down in her mind. The mothership approached weapons range at a painful crawl. The enemy fighters, now behind her, were slowly turning to follow them, with a clear shot at Aisha’s tail. She’d turned off their lasers, directing their energy to the shields, so they’d need to be close for ballistic weapons to be effective. It was going to be tight. Once the enemy fighters had turned around, the back of Aisha’s fighter was exposed. The lead ones had almost turned and were ready to open fire. But then Soo-Kyung had her target locked and opened up with everything she had on the mothership. Direct hits, but the ship stayed intact. A hit on their right-wing made the ship lurch. “Now would be a good time, Soo-Kyung.” Aisha looked to her left, seeing her friend’s face deep in concentration. Another torpedo launched, hitting a module to the rear of the mothership’s bridge. A small explosion was followed by several large ones, but before the ship was destroyed, Aisha’s ship was hit again. This time right in the engines. Aisha felt her ship lurch. Red lights were all over her console. The reactor had taken a direct hit. It was about to go critical. Her heart was beating hard. She reached for the eject buttons, hesitating long enough to see the mothership go up in a ball of flame. The moment’s hesitation was enough. She felt the ship lurch as the reactor gave out. Her mind slowed as the white flash enveloped them. She had enough time to realize, with resignation, that she was dead. Both co-pilots too. The simulator door opened, and Captain Simms’ craggy face looked in at her. “You’re dead. All of you. Again,” he said. Disapproval in his voice. “I thought you guys were better than that.” PART ONE: A Letter From My Father CHAPTER 1 Departures My Dearest Aisha: I don’t even know how to begin writing this letter. I look at you now, sleeping in your crib, so small and so helpless, and I wish I could be there with you when you take your first steps. I wish I could see it when you get on the bus for your first day of school. I wish I could hold you when you come home crying for the first time, realizing that the world is a bigger and worse place than you could have ever imagined. But I won’t be. The disease that is tearing through my body will take me away from you soon. And I’m so very sorry. But, so that I won’t be a distant and mysterious memory, I’m writing you this letter. For you have a destiny. A bright and wonderful destiny… THE TRANSPORT PLANE was older and more rickety than she would have expected for one headed to the spaceport. Aisha peered out the window of the plane intently, waiting for her first glimpse of the great cable veering skyward from Kiritimati into the depths of space. It even had the old-school seats facing each other across a small table. A man sat there, and he was watching her closely. “It’s nothing really special,” he said. “You don’t see anything. It’s only interesting when a launch happens.” “How often?” she asked, knowing the answer already. She always knew the answer already, but she asked anyway. “It depends,” he said, looking at his watch. “We build the shuttle onsite and then launch it. It’s not worth bringing it back to Earth, where it would burn up in the atmosphere, so it’s designed to be launched once, and then disassembled into different things to be used up there.” He pointed at the sky. “I’m going up tomorrow,” she said. He nodded, smiling. “I figured. We get a lot of kids your age coming through here, heading for the Academy.” He smiled and went back to reading the news from his tablet. He hadn’t said anything about her color. Mother had insisted on telling everyone within earshot that Aisha was the first African-American to go to the Academy. And not only was she African-American, but she was also a girl. Aisha groaned inwardly. She wished mother would just stop. It had been a couple of hours since they had left Hawaii. The plane flew south to the tiny atoll that Aisha couldn’t take her eyes off of. Upon arrival, they would take the short trip out to the bottom of the cable, and the fleet of ships imaginatively called Terminus. That would be the last stop before she launched into orbit, leaving Earth behind. The man lowered his tablet and pointed to a silver dot on the horizon. “That’s a shuttle right there,” he said. “And if you look closely you can see the cable that makes up the Space Elevator.” Even the words sounded amazing to her. The Space Elevator. Since the invention of materials with the requisite strength in low enough density to make the concept buildable, many nations had gathered together to build this one. The idea was simple. Tether a cable on the Earth near the equator, and extend it out into space for about 35,000 kilometers. The object on the far end of the cable would then be in geostationary orbit, always above the same position on the Earth, much like communications or TV satellites. She peered, trying to make out the cable, but it was just too skinny to be seen from this distance – except for the occasional glint as the tropical sun reflected off it. Because the cable was tethered to the surface of the Earth, the rotation of the planet would send any object attached to the cable flying out from the center of gravity, propelling it into space. Once it reached the top of the cable, it could then launch itself outward, using a tiny fraction of the fuel that a traditional rocket launch would use up. Almost overnight, it revolutionized space travel. One of the first things the international community had agreed upon was to build an academy. Its goal: To teach a new generation of humans what it would be like to have a single, coherent community, not hindered by the tropes of the past. Ultimately, such a community would be the future of mankind, its backers had argued, and would put an end to the wars that nearly destroyed us all. Aisha opened her locket and looked at his face, trying to remember him. Ravaged by cancers from radiation suffered in war, her father died before she reached her first birthday. He smiled back at her from the tiny picture, and she could see the pride in his smile. I did it, Dad. I made it into space, and I made sure that you would never be forgotten. That the next phase of humanity will have a little part of you in it. That was worth fighting for. I just wish you didn’t have to die for it. The plane jolted as it began to descend, waking Mother. “Are we there yet?” Aisha smiled to herself. “We’re almost at the Terminus.” Mother smiled and looked at the man sitting across from Aisha. “She’s going to the Space Academy, you know,” she said, smiling. The man nodded. “You must be so proud.” “Oh, I am,” said Mother. “She’ll always be my little girl, but to be the first African-American, and one of the first girls up there, it’s so exciting.” “I’m sure,” said the man. “I think she’ll do amazing things.” “Aww, you’re so nice,” said Mother, milking the compliment for all it was worth. He said nothing and went back to reading. Irked, mother looked around for someone else to impress. The plane lurched again, so she closed her eyes instead, fighting back airsickness. Mother was never good at flying. Aisha turned back to the window, catching the man’s eye with his small smile. He nodded at her, and she returned the gesture. The ground rushed at them, and with a jolt, they landed on the small airstrip. Since the construction of the Space Elevator had begun, this tiny island had changed from being a rock in the middle of the ocean to a thriving miniature city. But land was at a premium, so all passenger transport still came through the tiny airstrip on the western side. Aisha had read that a new floating airport was under construction. When it opened, the island would be connected directly to the mainland of the USA and other countries, instead of needing a transport plane like this one flying out of Hawaii. As she got out of the plane, Aisha could feel the warm breeze and hear the crash of the surf. A rocky beach lay just to her right, within walking distance of the airstrip. Mother emerged, blinking in the bright light. A representative of the Academy greeted them and led them towards a small set of prefabricated buildings that served as the registration center. A tiny look of disappointment crossed Mother’s face. Aisha rolled her eyes. Mother was probably expecting more press to meet them here, presumably not having enough of them in Hawaii. The only cadet on the arriving flight, Aisha strolled after the greeter, calling for Mother to keep up. The warm humid air felt good in her lungs. For the next few years she would be breathing processed air in the space station, so she wanted to make the most of it. She wondered if there would be time for the beach. The administrative center was as plain on the inside as it was on the outside. A threadbare box, it housed several desks at which sat tired-looking administrators swiping through computer terminals. The greeter read Mother’s disappointed gaze. “Here’s where we just make sure you are whom you say you are before taking the boat across to the Elevator. It helps us make sure that people don’t sneak aboard.” Mother raised her eyebrows. “What kind of people sneak aboard? Terrorists? It doesn’t look like you could stop them!” The greeter smiled a little, and to Aisha, it looked practiced. “No terrorist could get within a thousand miles of this place. No, we’re more concerned about curious onlookers, too many relatives of cadets, that type of thing.” His words confused Aisha. How could a terrorist be stopped from getting here, when just about anybody could fly here, including too many family members? Was it all a front, or were they profiling everything about every person who even tried to come to this place? She held her tongue. If Mother thought there was any profiling going on, she’d launch into one of her rants. “I hear the hotel is very nice,” Aisha said, changing the subject. “Yes,” said the greeter. “We want your last night on planet Earth to be special.” “But she’ll be coming back, for vacations and the like,” said Mother. “So it’s hardly her last night.” “Of course,” said the greeter, smiling, before ushering them to a desk where the clerk had finally booted up his screen. “You’re our last flight of the day today,” he said cheerfully. “But don’t worry - you aren’t the only launchie. The others are at the Terminus ahead of you, so you’ll have plenty of friends for the ride up.” Aisha smiled. She didn’t need friends, but it was best not to argue. “Ah Miss Parks,” he continued, checking her credentials. “I heard you were coming today, it’s very nice to have you aboard.” “Thanks,” said Aisha. “But I just want to be like any other student.” “Yes,” he continued. “The media have made a big deal about it down here, but once you get up there, all that will be forgotten.” Mother piqued up. “What?” “We try to keep the kids insulated from political and social matters down on Earth,” he said in a trained voice. “That way they can focus on their work.” “But she is the first African-American to be accepted since open enrollment. Not only that, she’s one of the first girls. That makes her very important.” “Ma’am,” said the receptionist. “Your daughter is extremely important, and in time you’ll find it’s not for those reasons, but for who she is and what she’s capable of doing. Her race, her gender, those things don’t matter.” “But she is the first African-American–” The man interrupted, albeit politely. “Of course,” he said. “And the press at Terminus will want to ask you all about that.” *</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Space Cadets - An AI-illustrated Novel.

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I’m going to use MidJourney. Previous chapters used DALL-E. Let me know what you think twitter.com/lmoroney&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;chapter-3&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;launch&quot;&gt;Launch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We should always reach for the sky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the very beginning of history, our ancestors were looking up and wondering what was beyond their reach. The stars were calling them. They weaved stories of gods and angels, but behind them all was the intense desire to be out there. A desire born of an instinct for survival.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of a girl looking at the stars from the african savannah&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s something we’ve forgotten as we’ve become civilized. We’ve become comfortable in our homes, our cities and our countries. We’ve defeated nature and haven’t had the same worries that they had. But we lost something in that complacency, I fear. And now, as our world gets overcrowded, as our environment collapses under us, we need to rediscover it. We need to look up, and not worry about tripping as we race towards a new destiny. We will be those gods and angels if we want to. And you can be one of them, if you just keep trying, and never give up…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha looking out the windows of the hotel towards the spaceport&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE SPACE ELEVATOR. Its relatively simple name belied the sheer scale of it. Craning her neck, Aisha looked up as it disappeared impossibly into the deep blue sky. The ‘shuttle’ was a box-like structure that could easily pass for another building, but for the rocket boosters placed on its corners. These boosters would provide the initial ‘launch’ to get the craft moving out of its gravitational inertia. After that, the rotation of the Earth would take over and drive the shuttle up the cable into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of a space elevator viewed from orbit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was so glad for last night’s dinner with Mother. Beforehand, it had felt like there was a tension building between them. Mother’s basking in her status had gotten under Aisha’s skin, and she had been worried that she might blow up at her before leaving. She was worried that she might end up regretting it, but there was only so long she could bite her tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of a Aishas mother watching the shuttle in the distance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She almost thanked the reporter for his rude question. It had brought them closer together. She felt a pang of pride again at Mother’s words that she had done exactly what Father would have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the same reporter had wrestled his way to the front of the audience, and was barking out questions to the cadets as they boarded the shuttle. She was happy she knew where he was, so she could actively ignore him as she passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave Mother one final hug, and turned and walked along the long ramp up to the shuttle. With every step away from her, Aisha felt more and more alone. As the entrance loomed toward her, she felt the urge to turn and run back to Mother’s welcoming arms. Mother would hold her and protect her, and to heck with anyone who would criticize her for not going through with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of the spaceport on a hawaiian island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She continued step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the ramp, she turned for one more look back at the Earth. She caught Mother’s eye as she waved frantically, blowing kisses and smiling. “That’s my little girl!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She raised her hand to wave, hearing cameras popping, and returned the smile before turning to enter the shuttle. Her feet suddenly felt heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was really going through with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was really leaving home and going into &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each step seemed to be a chore, doubt and indecision weighing on her more heavily than gravity ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step-by-step she continued forward. The entrance lobby curved away from the door, and in a few moments, the daylight was lost. Words she had learned from history came back to her. Alea iacta est. She smiled, thinking that her Classics teacher would be proud of her. The die is cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of the entrance lobby of a space elevator shuttle, windows overlooking to ocean beyond&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior of the shuttle was clearly designed to impress and soothe its occupants. Instead of the functional ships of yesteryear, it was all polished chrome and intricately-designed surfaces. In the days of rocket travel to the stars, every ounce of payload had to be carefully measured, with no room for luxury, as propelling something into orbit required enormous amounts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Elevator changed all that, so designers of spacecraft were free to allow their occupants to be comfortable with traveling into space. This was also an important factor as many more people would leave the surface of the Earth – and a good, comfortable experience made it more tolerable, and thus less training was necessary. Indeed, Aisha had little more training than a couple of video tutorials explaining how to deal with weightlessness, and what to eat or not to eat prior to boarding. It was also good advice to use the bathroom before getting on the ship, for while facilities were available, using them in weightless conditions wasn’t optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She climbed stairs to the observation deck where she would spend most of the journey. The deck was a wide circle with multi story windows, and acceleration couches arranged facing outwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of the space elevator observation deck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we rise up the cable, the shuttle will spin slowly,” she had remembered the tutorial video telling her. “So pick any seat, and you’ll still be able to see everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha in an acceleration sofa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deck was terraced, so that seats near the back would still have a great view, and their occupants may not have the feeling of vertigo that those closer to the front would encounter. She picked one in the back row, next to an Asian girl who looked about Aisha’s age. The girl was intensely reading a book on her tablet, and didn’t look up as Aisha sat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha in an acceleration sofa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She suddenly spoke. “Aisha Parks, celebrity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha looked at her. “I’m not sure about that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl looked up, and her intense eyes searched Aisha’s. “Good to know,” she said finally, reaching a hand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Soo-Kyung Kim,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha meeting Soo-Kyung&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t need to tell you my name, I guess.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo-Kyung smiled. Her plain face lit up when she smiled. She was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So where are you from?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo-Kyung smiled again. “You haven’t heard of me? Good. I guess I am not a celebrity, either.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an odd answer, and from Soo-Kyung’s reaction, it was clear that Aisha’s confusion was written on her face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we are going to be good friends,” said Soo-Kyung. “I like how you are straightforward. I am too, but that intimidates some people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-11.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Aisha and Soo-Kyung chatting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So where are you from?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am from a small village called Sijungho,” continued Soo Kyung. “There’s not much to see there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sounds Korean,” said Aisha. “You from South Korea?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“North Korea,” corrected Soo-Kyung. “I’ve never even been to South Korea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha felt her insides go cold. Against her will, she shuddered a little, and felt a sob begin to escape from her throat. Her father had died as a result of radiation sickness incurred in the second Korean War. And there was a North Korean girl here with her. Going into space with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She knew there was incredulity in her voice, but she couldn’t mask it. “Are you going to the Academy too?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” said Soo-Kyung. “And don’t worry, I’m as surprised as you are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s what you meant by celebrity?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It seems the media made as big a deal about me being the first North Korean as it did about you being the first African-American to go through open enrollment. It’s all a sham though, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m beginning to gather that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, when the Academy was first built, it was apparent that it was for the Elites, most of whom are from Western society, with a few Russians and Chinese thrown in to get funding. Nobody really knows who the students were, but it was typically those who would be in private elite schools on the surface, so being in space made little difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha thought about what Soo-Kyung was saying, and realized that she was right. Amazing that she had never thought of this herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Korean girl continued. “Now that they are all in place and established, it’s time to open it up to the rest of the world, so we can get their proverbial ‘sloppy seconds’, I guess.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s an academy,” said Aisha. “And we’re cadets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The cannon fodder, while they are the officers ordering us around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So why are you going through with it? Why am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; going through with it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo-Kyung shrugged. “Because it’s better than &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going through with it. Besides, there might be something great waiting for normal people like us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My father died in Korea,” said Aisha, surprising even herself at the change in subject. “But he always told my mother to tell me that I had a destiny. That the emerging age of space flight was one in which we must be free to explore the universe. He fought so that that freedom would still exist, so that I could do this. I can’t turn back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Most of my family died in the same war,” said Soo-Kyung. “But nothing ever really changed, did it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha realized that she must have sounded bitter, and the bitterness was reflected in Soo-Kyung’s answer. 
“I’m sorry,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No need,” said Soo-Kyung. “I’m glad that you are open and honest with me. Most people, particularly outside of my country, are not. They learn about where I’m from and think I need special treatment. I don’t. I’ve learned to stand on my own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had your strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t,” said Soo-Kyung, suddenly serious. “&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; kind of strength comes from trying to make a life in a country destroyed by nuclear war. You never want it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://storage.googleapis.com/odml-codelabs/Images/SC/Part1/space-cadets-3-12.png&quot; alt=&quot;Midjourney generated image of Soo-Kyung as a little girl in North Korea as nukes fall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we’re going into space, isn’t it? To make sure that wars like those will never put our species’ survival at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That would be nice,” said Soo-Kyung. “But if anything I think it will cause more wars and hardship before things get better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why?” 
“Because the only thing that stopped the entire world from burning during the war over my country was that it was the only world we have. If we discover more planets, livable ones, that will no longer be the case. And I want to be as far away from this world as possible before the next bombs fall.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Aisha could answer, the soft tone of the launch warning sounded. The rocket boost would be gentler than a typical aircraft take off, but safety protocols required that they be buckled into their crash seats in case anything went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She rolled her eyes and smiled, and strapped herself in. When everything was snug, she turned to look at Soo-Kyung. Their eyes met again, and Soo-Kyung bowed slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engines kicked in, and their seats lurched a little. From all around came the muffled sounds of the rockets roaring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the windows, Aisha could see the ground begin to slowly fall away. Within a few seconds the flotilla was no longer visible, and as they began to rise, she could see the entire outline of the nearby Kiritimati, where only yesterday they had landed. It felt like an eternity ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wondered how Mother felt, watching her shuttle rise slowly to the sky. As suddenly as they had begun, the rockets cut out, and there was another slight lurch as the inertia of the ship was stopped. She remembered the video training – this was the scariest part of the trip, where the shuttle, under normal gravity, could fall back to Earth and kill everyone aboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it didn’t, and the force on the Space Elevator started pushing them skyward, with ever-increasing speed. The horizon began to spin also, and as they rose up, she watched the island recede. Before long they were high enough to see that the horizon was curved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was it. This was for real. She was headed into space!&lt;/p&gt;

In this article, I’m going to use MidJourney. Previous chapters used DALL-E. Let me know what you think twitter.com/lmoroney CHAPTER 3 Launch We should always reach for the sky. From the very beginning of history, our ancestors were looking up and wondering what was beyond their reach. The stars were calling them. They weaved stories of gods and angels, but behind them all was the intense desire to be out there. A desire born of an instinct for survival. It’s something we’ve forgotten as we’ve become civilized. We’ve become comfortable in our homes, our cities and our countries. We’ve defeated nature and haven’t had the same worries that they had. But we lost something in that complacency, I fear. And now, as our world gets overcrowded, as our environment collapses under us, we need to rediscover it. We need to look up, and not worry about tripping as we race towards a new destiny. We will be those gods and angels if we want to. And you can be one of them, if you just keep trying, and never give up… THE SPACE ELEVATOR. Its relatively simple name belied the sheer scale of it. Craning her neck, Aisha looked up as it disappeared impossibly into the deep blue sky. The ‘shuttle’ was a box-like structure that could easily pass for another building, but for the rocket boosters placed on its corners. These boosters would provide the initial ‘launch’ to get the craft moving out of its gravitational inertia. After that, the rotation of the Earth would take over and drive the shuttle up the cable into orbit. She was so glad for last night’s dinner with Mother. Beforehand, it had felt like there was a tension building between them. Mother’s basking in her status had gotten under Aisha’s skin, and she had been worried that she might blow up at her before leaving. She was worried that she might end up regretting it, but there was only so long she could bite her tongue. She almost thanked the reporter for his rude question. It had brought them closer together. She felt a pang of pride again at Mother’s words that she had done exactly what Father would have done. Of course, the same reporter had wrestled his way to the front of the audience, and was barking out questions to the cadets as they boarded the shuttle. She was happy she knew where he was, so she could actively ignore him as she passed. She gave Mother one final hug, and turned and walked along the long ramp up to the shuttle. With every step away from her, Aisha felt more and more alone. As the entrance loomed toward her, she felt the urge to turn and run back to Mother’s welcoming arms. Mother would hold her and protect her, and to heck with anyone who would criticize her for not going through with it. But she didn’t. She continued step-by-step. At the top of the ramp, she turned for one more look back at the Earth. She caught Mother’s eye as she waved frantically, blowing kisses and smiling. “That’s my little girl!” She raised her hand to wave, hearing cameras popping, and returned the smile before turning to enter the shuttle. Her feet suddenly felt heavy. She was really going through with this. She was really leaving home and going into space. Each step seemed to be a chore, doubt and indecision weighing on her more heavily than gravity ever could. Step-by-step she continued forward. The entrance lobby curved away from the door, and in a few moments, the daylight was lost. Words she had learned from history came back to her. Alea iacta est. She smiled, thinking that her Classics teacher would be proud of her. The die is cast. The interior of the shuttle was clearly designed to impress and soothe its occupants. Instead of the functional ships of yesteryear, it was all polished chrome and intricately-designed surfaces. In the days of rocket travel to the stars, every ounce of payload had to be carefully measured, with no room for luxury, as propelling something into orbit required enormous amounts of energy. The Space Elevator changed all that, so designers of spacecraft were free to allow their occupants to be comfortable with traveling into space. This was also an important factor as many more people would leave the surface of the Earth – and a good, comfortable experience made it more tolerable, and thus less training was necessary. Indeed, Aisha had little more training than a couple of video tutorials explaining how to deal with weightlessness, and what to eat or not to eat prior to boarding. It was also good advice to use the bathroom before getting on the ship, for while facilities were available, using them in weightless conditions wasn’t optimal. She climbed stairs to the observation deck where she would spend most of the journey. The deck was a wide circle with multi story windows, and acceleration couches arranged facing outwards. “As we rise up the cable, the shuttle will spin slowly,” she had remembered the tutorial video telling her. “So pick any seat, and you’ll still be able to see everything.” The deck was terraced, so that seats near the back would still have a great view, and their occupants may not have the feeling of vertigo that those closer to the front would encounter. She picked one in the back row, next to an Asian girl who looked about Aisha’s age. The girl was intensely reading a book on her tablet, and didn’t look up as Aisha sat. She suddenly spoke. “Aisha Parks, celebrity.” Aisha looked at her. “I’m not sure about that.” The girl looked up, and her intense eyes searched Aisha’s. “Good to know,” she said finally, reaching a hand out. “Soo-Kyung Kim,” she said. “I don’t need to tell you my name, I guess.” Soo-Kyung smiled. Her plain face lit up when she smiled. She was beautiful. “So where are you from?” Soo-Kyung smiled again. “You haven’t heard of me? Good. I guess I am not a celebrity, either.” Such an odd answer, and from Soo-Kyung’s reaction, it was clear that Aisha’s confusion was written on her face. “I think we are going to be good friends,” said Soo-Kyung. “I like how you are straightforward. I am too, but that intimidates some people.” “So where are you from?” “I am from a small village called Sijungho,” continued Soo Kyung. “There’s not much to see there.” “Sounds Korean,” said Aisha. “You from South Korea?” “North Korea,” corrected Soo-Kyung. “I’ve never even been to South Korea.” Aisha felt her insides go cold. Against her will, she shuddered a little, and felt a sob begin to escape from her throat. Her father had died as a result of radiation sickness incurred in the second Korean War. And there was a North Korean girl here with her. Going into space with her. She knew there was incredulity in her voice, but she couldn’t mask it. “Are you going to the Academy too?” “Yes,” said Soo-Kyung. “And don’t worry, I’m as surprised as you are.” “That’s what you meant by celebrity?” “It seems the media made as big a deal about me being the first North Korean as it did about you being the first African-American to go through open enrollment. It’s all a sham though, isn’t it?” “I’m beginning to gather that.” “I mean, when the Academy was first built, it was apparent that it was for the Elites, most of whom are from Western society, with a few Russians and Chinese thrown in to get funding. Nobody really knows who the students were, but it was typically those who would be in private elite schools on the surface, so being in space made little difference.” Aisha thought about what Soo-Kyung was saying, and realized that she was right. Amazing that she had never thought of this herself. The Korean girl continued. “Now that they are all in place and established, it’s time to open it up to the rest of the world, so we can get their proverbial ‘sloppy seconds’, I guess.” “It’s an academy,” said Aisha. “And we’re cadets.” “The cannon fodder, while they are the officers ordering us around.” “So why are you going through with it? Why am I going through with it?” Soo-Kyung shrugged. “Because it’s better than not going through with it. Besides, there might be something great waiting for normal people like us.” “My father died in Korea,” said Aisha, surprising even herself at the change in subject. “But he always told my mother to tell me that I had a destiny. That the emerging age of space flight was one in which we must be free to explore the universe. He fought so that that freedom would still exist, so that I could do this. I can’t turn back.” “Most of my family died in the same war,” said Soo-Kyung. “But nothing ever really changed, did it?” Aisha realized that she must have sounded bitter, and the bitterness was reflected in Soo-Kyung’s answer. “I’m sorry,” she said. “No need,” said Soo-Kyung. “I’m glad that you are open and honest with me. Most people, particularly outside of my country, are not. They learn about where I’m from and think I need special treatment. I don’t. I’ve learned to stand on my own.” “I wish I had your strength.” “You don’t,” said Soo-Kyung, suddenly serious. “That kind of strength comes from trying to make a life in a country destroyed by nuclear war. You never want it.” “That’s why we’re going into space, isn’t it? To make sure that wars like those will never put our species’ survival at risk.” “That would be nice,” said Soo-Kyung. “But if anything I think it will cause more wars and hardship before things get better.” “Why?” “Because the only thing that stopped the entire world from burning during the war over my country was that it was the only world we have. If we discover more planets, livable ones, that will no longer be the case. And I want to be as far away from this world as possible before the next bombs fall.” Before Aisha could answer, the soft tone of the launch warning sounded. The rocket boost would be gentler than a typical aircraft take off, but safety protocols required that they be buckled into their crash seats in case anything went wrong. She rolled her eyes and smiled, and strapped herself in. When everything was snug, she turned to look at Soo-Kyung. Their eyes met again, and Soo-Kyung bowed slightly. The engines kicked in, and their seats lurched a little. From all around came the muffled sounds of the rockets roaring. Through the windows, Aisha could see the ground begin to slowly fall away. Within a few seconds the flotilla was no longer visible, and as they began to rise, she could see the entire outline of the nearby Kiritimati, where only yesterday they had landed. It felt like an eternity ago. She wondered how Mother felt, watching her shuttle rise slowly to the sky. As suddenly as they had begun, the rockets cut out, and there was another slight lurch as the inertia of the ship was stopped. She remembered the video training – this was the scariest part of the trip, where the shuttle, under normal gravity, could fall back to Earth and kill everyone aboard.

&lt;p&gt;This much maligned and lampooned cloth is actually quite nice. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It arrives in letterbox packaging like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cloth1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cloth package&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple makes great products, and they fully understand that the packaging is part of the experience. If you’ve ever spent time in Asia, it’s a very asian thing. Your moments of delight start right at the first glance and touch on the product. That’s what they’ve done here. It feels nice and sturdy. It has a pull tag at the bottom that’s labeled with a little green arrow that you can peel to open the package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tear and unfold to see this. Simple. Elegant. Almost cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cloth4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;First look at the cloth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove the cloth and you’ll see that the cloth is folded in half, and is roughly square in shape. It has a very nice embossed monogram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cloth5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monogram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at the monogram and the cloth itself. It’s much sturdier than I originally thought, and I can so see myself using this to clean my MacBook pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cloth2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monogram Closeup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now people might mock spending $19 on a cloth, and if it were just a cloth, I might agree. To be fair, it’s a super premium one, and instead of paying 10x what you should pay, it’s probably more like 2x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the compatibility list online is definitely worth a little mockery!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the cloth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; – and be sure to check the compatibility list to see if the cloth will work for you! For example, it won’t work on my 2011 iMac. But enquiring minds want to know – if I try to clean it with this cloth, will it break the cloth, or will it break the iMac???&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Laurence Moroney</name></author><category term="life" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html">So I took the plunge and bought one of the famous $19 Cleaning Cloths from Apple.

The goal of this course, as its name suggests, is to be a broad introduction of what AI is (and perhaps more importantly, what it isn’t) designed for everybody to enjoy! No engineering, no programming, no math required. The course will begin with an introduction to what AI is all about and understand where it stands in the hype cycle. I’ll demonstrate examples where common conceptions about AI are wrong and how we can easily fall into fear about the possibilities instead of being encouraged by the opportunities. Through understanding the hype lifecycle and getting to the point of understanding the realities of AI, we’ll also look at examples where people followed the curve and became productive. I’ll share a fun anecdote of how the actor David Hewlett of Stargate fame broke through the hype and came up with some great innovative ideas for using AI in his industry! Using the examples of games, medicine, self-driving cars, and others, we’ll dig into how people build AI systems using data. If you’re interested in building AI models, I have other courses and books to help! If you want, once you’ve gained a high-level understanding of how AI and Machine Learning work, we’ll also go a little lower and explore the anatomy of an artificial neuron and how it’s just a simple mathematical function. When these functions work together similarly to biological neurons, exciting things can happen! The course will wrap up with a discussion about the ethics of AI systems, particularly when used to make important decisions about people’s lives, and a roundup of some of the tools that will help you avoid mistakes! You can access the course on edX today! Here’s the table of contents: Chapter 1: Introduction to AI Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1. What is AI? 1.2. Understanding Data 1.3.

Given how many attempts there have been for Machine Learning models to consume scripts and to attempt to come up with stories of their own, why couldn’t we do something similar for Stargate – where there are over 300 episodes of TV, several TV movies, and a lot more in the corpus of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal: Create an AI that writes a script for Stargate, and then get a number of the actors from the original show(s) together to do a table read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve watched any AI-generated media, you’ll immediately see that they rapidly deteriorate into gibberish. The famous ‘Sunspring’ movie is a great example. Check it out here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;extensions extensions--video&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LY7x2Ihqjmc?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunspring was generated by a model called Jetson, and, as you’ll see in the video, it was created using a technique called LSTM – which stands for ‘Long Short Term Memory,’ and it’s a way that a machine learning model can understand context in a sequence, and predict what should come next in that sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good for writing text – given a series of words – it can predict the next likely word in the corpus. So, for example, if an LSTM was trained on Star Wars, and given the sequence “May the force,” it would quite likely predict the next word to be “be”. They’re a lot of fun, but as you think about it, the reason why they become gibberish quickly is that they really only predict one word at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you were to start a sequence with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“May the force”, it would likely predict “be”. I say ‘likely,’ because it will look at every possible word used in ‘Star Wars,’ and then calculate the probability of each one being the next word. Say ‘be’ has an 80% probability. Now you have “May the force be,” and you want to get the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; word. It will do the same – and calculate the probability of every word used in Star Wars, and the most likely one is ‘with,’ with, say a 70% probability. Then the next word, of course will be ‘you.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then what? ‘be with you,’ would be generated, but what would come next? This is a phrase that happens a lot in that corpus – so “May the force be with you,” is relatively easy to generate. The next word will be calculated based on the probabilities of every word in the corpus…so it’s unlikely it will have a high probability like ‘be,’ ‘with,’ and ‘you’ had. And the next one would be even lower and so on. Thus, very quickly, low probability words would be spat out. And very quickly, the script would become gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more detail – check out my tutorial series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzDbLUZkbudP-MFQZwNmU4S&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where I teach Natural Language Processing (NLP), and show how to create lyrics for traditional Irish songs with an LSTM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-stargate-neeeded-something-better&quot;&gt;But Stargate neeeded something better&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that this LSTM-based approach would get us into gibberish territory really quickly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; knowing that we would be working with a limited set of characters who weren’t all in all 300+ episodes together, I wanted to approach this a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first step was to understand the anatomy of a script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically a script will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/scriptsnippet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example script page with annotations for Scene Heading, Action and Dialog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the architecture of a script. There’s a scene heading that sets the scene – in this case we can see a hospital in LA in 1941. There’s an &lt;em&gt;action description&lt;/em&gt; that tells you what’s going on, and then there’s dialog – what each character says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what, I thought – if I build models for &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of these elements. Given a scene heading (for example INT. ATLANTIS GATEROOM,) what type of &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; description would follow? It might come up with something like “The Stargate is active.”. Then I can choose to continue with the action, and it may come up with “An alarm goes off, incoming wormhole,” and the story begins to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the script, actors usually have some kind of response to the action, so, at that point, what if I trained a model for each character, and how they respond to action? Perhaps the character, in response to the above text might say “Unscheduled offworld activation,”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then…what if I also created a model for each character that predicts how they might respond to dialog, as well as action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and the idea of a cluster of models was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for the Stargate AI project, that’s what we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A model to predict action from a scene heading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A model to predict more action from existing action&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A model to prediction action in response to dialog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, for each character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A model to predict dialog from action&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A model to predict dialog from dialog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A model to continue dialog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Stargate AI has three confirmed characters (McKay, Jackson, Carter,) this involved the creation and training of 12 models, each with between 1 and 2 million parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and there’s more on the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to continue to push the state of the art with this, instead of using LSTM, I opted instead to use a &lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt; architecture. I’ll cover more of that in future articles, but the idea of that architecture is to predict sequences as opposed to individual words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with a transformer, you would feed it a sequence like “May the force be with you,” and it might come back with “and also with you,” which is more realistic for a script-writing AI like we’re trying to build for Stargate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-data&quot;&gt;The Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll go into more detail on the Transformers in a future article, but, if you’re into ML and AI, you know the hardest part is getting the data. So, in the video below I allude a little to how we did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a new XML-variant that I call SML (Script Markup Language) that allows me to pull dialog out of a scene (i.e. if I’m predicting dialog from action, it should be action in the same scene, not the previous one!) and from there train a model quickly an easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sample of SML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dialog character=&apos;CARTER&apos;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;spoken s=&apos;4&apos; i=&apos;4&apos;&amp;gt;Mining what?&amp;lt;/spoken&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dialog&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;dialog character=&apos;MCKAY&apos;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;spoken s=&apos;4&apos; i=&apos;5&apos;&amp;gt;Havent a clue. Whatever it was, they cleaned out the deposits and left.&amp;lt;/spoken&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dialog&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;dialog character=&apos;CARTER&apos;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;spoken s=&apos;4&apos; i=&apos;6&apos;&amp;gt;So…?&amp;lt;/spoken&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dialog&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;dialog character=&apos;SHEPPARD&apos;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;spoken s=&apos;4&apos; i=&apos;7&apos;&amp;gt;So, they think were like the Genii, and they want their cut.&amp;lt;/spoken&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dialog&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;dialog character=&apos;CARTER&apos;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;spoken s=&apos;4&apos; i=&apos;8&apos;&amp;gt;Ah.&amp;lt;/spoken&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dialog&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;dialog character=&apos;KELLER&apos;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;spoken s=&apos;4&apos; i=&apos;9&apos;&amp;gt;Theyre willing to move, but they have a list of demands a mile and a half long.&amp;lt;/spoken&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dialog&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;dialog character=&apos;SHEPPARD&apos;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;spoken s=&apos;4&apos; i=&apos;10&apos;&amp;gt;And negotiating with alien settlements is not exactly why I joined the Air Force.&amp;lt;/spoken&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dialog&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;action s=&apos;4&apos;&amp;gt;[Carter half-quirks a wry smile.]&amp;lt;/action&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more in this video, where Brad, David Hewlett and I announce and discuss the project:&lt;/p&gt;

You can download it for yourself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/skills-reports/global&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/learning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of A road leading to the horizon with the words &apos;Never Stop Learning&apos; on it&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been clear for some time that a digital transformation is underway, and that the skills to succeed in tomorrow’s will be vastly different than those of today. I’ve personally had the mission to grow the number of AI-savvy people to help bootstrap that transformation, but I’m amazed by how accelerated the growth has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take nothing else from the report, take this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fig1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure showing job growth from 41M in 2020 to 190M in 2025&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital jobs in 2020 were around 41M. By 2025, just 4 years from now, they’ll be at 190M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth is almost 3.5x over 5 years, which is unprecedented! Not only that, it predicts that of those 149M new jobs, &lt;em&gt;98 Million&lt;/em&gt; will be in Software Development &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a further 20 Million will be in Data Analysis, Machine Learning and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this comes from research into digital transformation that was conducted by Microsoft showing that two years worth of transformation was concentrated into 2 months because of lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short – the digital and AI future is arriving &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When exploring the report, you’ll see, across the board that every sector is projecting massive increases in Software Development roles in particular, leading to the 98M total new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there’s never been a better time to get into Software Development, or to refresh your current skills if you are a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top desired skills vary by dimain, but many of them have free tutorials on Coursera and elsewhere. Some I’d like to call out are:&lt;/p&gt;
